The day that [Netscape](http://www.netscape.com/) goes public, Jerry Garcia dies of a heart attack. Coincidence? I think not. Jerry must have had a buy order in at 71, and watched it plummet to 52.

I read Dave Winer's [DaveNet](http://www.hotwired.com/userland/) pieces regularly, but have never responded. Until yesterday. Email makes everything seem so personal. I'm not a letter to the editor type... But Dave's inbox rules probably filtered out my missive. Depressing.

I bought something over the [Internet Shopping Network](http://www.internet.net/) a couple of days ago. Then I hear this morning that Netscape's SSL encryption was broken by a couple of guys in France using some Cray supercomputers. Great.

August 24th is almost upon us. Word from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) is that they're planning a half-hour prime time infomercial to push Windows 95, with [er](http://www.nbc.com/) star Anthony Edwards hosting. The Revenge of the Nerds is complete.
