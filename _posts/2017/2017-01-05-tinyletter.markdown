It's 2017, so I figured I should hop on the e-newsletter bandwagon. Three things you should know before <a href="http://tinyletter.com/sippey">subscribing</a>. 

1. It will arrive very infrequently.
2. It's email, so there are no permalinks. Enjoy it in your inbox, the way God intended e-newsletters to be enjoyed. Want to share it? Hit that "Forward" button.
3. There is no third thing. 

Happy new year?
