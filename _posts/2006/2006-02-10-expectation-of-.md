I don't know about you, but I generally operate from the assumption that [conversations I have with another person](http://www.caterina.net/archive/000945.html) are "[off the record](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&hl=en&answer=29291)"\[1\] unless we both explicitly agree that they're "on the record."\[2\]

\[1\] Default settings matter.  A lot.  Especially when the defaults are set 180 degrees from the user's mental model.  
\[2\] What's the IM equivalent of the ever-present "this call may be monitored or recorded for quality purposes?"
