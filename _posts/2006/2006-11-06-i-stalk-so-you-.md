Alex Ross on Steve Reich's _Piano Phase_ [in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/critics/music/articles/061113crmu_music):

> The opening section uses only the notes E, F-sharp, B, C-sharp, and D, which, when run together in rapid patterns, suggest the key of B minor. Halfway in, the note A is added to the series, tilting the harmony toward A major. This small change never fails to have a brightening, energizing impact. Pieces like this can leave you happy for hours, like drugs without the mess.

And Ross has a [great post on his blog](http://www.therestisnoise.com/2006/11/more_on_reich.html) with a bunch of links to Reich related stuff (birthday and otherwise), including [a YouTube'd performance of Eight Lines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuJCp9wsaj8&eurl=) from London.
