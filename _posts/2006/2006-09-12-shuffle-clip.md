So the [new Ipod Shuffle's a clip](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/).  Neat!  Here's [something I wrote](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/01/shuffling_light.html) back in January of last year about the original Shuffle.

> It's light enough to be remarkably light.  Ridiculously light, even.  So light as to truly deserve the "wearable" label.  Which is why I'm surprised they're shipping with a lanyard instead of some sort of integrated clip (like some other flash-based music players).  Lanyards would be great if headphones were wireless; otherwise you end up being a mess of cabling.  A clip would be perfect -- clip it to your shirt, your pocket, your bag strap, your coat collar, your _tie_ even.

So, um, yeah.  A clip.  As I said...neat!
