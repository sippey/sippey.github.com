<p>A Diet Coke, a cigarette, an arched eyebrow, a bit of gossip, a good helping of advice, an inside joke, a copy of the record you have to hear, a pointer to the artist you have to know about, an introduction to the person you must meet, a story you just can't believe.</p>

<p>Leslie Harpold made everyone who knew her <strong>better</strong>. And we're all in her debt.</p>
