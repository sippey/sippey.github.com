<p>&quot;When the devil came / He was not red / He was chrome, and he said / Come with me / You must go / So I went / Where everything was clean / So precise and towering.&nbsp; I was welcomed / With open arms / I received so much help in every way / I felt no fear / I felt no fear.&quot; (Wilco)</p>
