The Times [dissects](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/business/media/16adco.html) pherotones.com, the viralbuzzmarketing campaign that promised ringtones that were supposed to attract the opposite sex...

> But rather than the revolutionary product that Pherotones promised, the ads were the beginning of a buzz marketing campaign under the guise of a fake product (Pherotones) and a fake doctor (Dr. Myra Vanderhood) with a fake Web site, all for a real client with less than $250,000 to spend.Â  The real client is Oasys Mobile, a little-known cellphone content provider that sells games, cellphone wallpaper and ring tones that can be downloaded.

> The social networking site MySpace, hugely successful among teenagers and twenty-somethings, is about to become more ubiquitous with the launch of a cellular service that will let users read and post to the site for free.

A match made in heaven, it would seem.
