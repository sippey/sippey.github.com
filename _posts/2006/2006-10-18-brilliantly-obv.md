Put a datacenter on your roof.  Or in a parking garage.  Or in your backyard.  Or on a battlefield.  Jonathan Schwartz on [Project Blackbox](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/a_logical_end_point):  "The biggest thing we could build would ultimately be the biggest thing we could transport around the world - which turned out to be a standardized shipping container. Why? Because the world's transportation infrastructure has been optimized for doing exactly this - moving packets containers on rails, roads and at sea."
