If I didn't already own almost every model they carry, this news would be terribly frightening:  [Timbuk2 is opening has opened* a retail store](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/cms/store.htm "Timbuk2 - Retail Store") in Hayes Valley in San Francisco.  Timbuk2 has done a terrific job of creating a compelling online experience (build your own bag, anyone?), so I'm interested to see how they do with retail.

The latest addition to my (always) growing collection of bags -- their [Ace Day Pack](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/retail/catalog.htm?categoryId=63&skusetId=121).  I've always hated laptop backpacks -- they're usually way too big and way too ugly -- but this one is just right.  Just the right size, just the right pockets and in all black you can't go wrong.  (They're not paying me, I swear...) 

Now, if only I could fill it with one of those sexy little 13" MacBooks...

\* Thanks, Owen!
