Turnhere.com has a great short (3:47) video on the [Gourmet Ghetto](http://www.turnhere.com/city/san_francisco/berkeley_east_bay/films/9.aspx) in Berkeley; the eight square blocks of foodie heaven just up the street from where we live.  (The guy in the beret is a fixture outside the original Peet's; he's about as Berkeley as you can get.) 

See also, in case you haven't read it already, Michael Chabon's fantastic essay [The Mysteries of Berkeley](http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/03/the_mysteries_o.html).
