A Diet Coke, a cigarette, an arched eyebrow, a bit of gossip, a good helping of advice, an inside joke, a copy of the record you have to hear, a pointer to the artist you have to know about, an introduction to the person you must meet, a story you just can't believe.

Leslie Harpold made everyone who knew her **better**. And we're all in her debt.
