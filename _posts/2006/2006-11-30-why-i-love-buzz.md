So last night I was telling someone about [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/), and how much I've been enjoying it, and they took a look and then asked the obvious question:  why?  And all day I've been struggling to come up with the one particular reason why I'm so enamored with the site, and I can't.  Instead, I think it's all of little things pieced together. 

Like the fact that it's a highly editorialized look at bottoms up behavior.  And, like other aggregation sites, it can then amplify what they find interesting.  And the category mix.  And the appreciative _and_ dismissive editorial voice.  And the judicious use of red, white and blue.  And the big fonts!  And the [claim](http://www.buzzfeed.com/about), made with a straight face, that "the moment we detect new buzz, it appears in a special terminal interface used by our editors."  And, finally, the indeterminate yet open-ended business model possibilities that signify the bright, shiny promise of web two point oh.

Oh, and I'm also enjoying [Very Short List](http://www.veryshortlist.com/), in case you're wondering.
