I have a friend who can't stand to listen to NPR in the car; she classifies it as "talk radio."  Which means she most likely missed the best interview I'd heard in a while, Steve Inskeep's conversation this morning with [Jason Simmons, a professional rock, paper, scissors player](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6466928).  Every second is gold; highly recommended.
