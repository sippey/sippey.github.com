I picked up  The Beatles _Love_ over the weekend, and on each listen it literally surprises me.  Leaving aside for a moment whether this is a "good" or "bad" thing, the record is an object lesson in Jeff Hawkins' memory-prediction framework as outlined in [On Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence).  Your brain, wired for years to expect one thing, gets something else entirely, triggering the "whoa" response.

It's impossible to listen to the record as "background music" while trying to perform other tasks, because your brain keeps interrupting you with "you need to pay attention to _this_ thing over _here_." While remixes aren't anything new, the deep grooves the original tracks have worn inside any Beatles fan's head makes listening to _Love_ a very different experience.
