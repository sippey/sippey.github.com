I just was given a webcam, but I really don't know what to do with it, other than have video chats with people that I'd rather just talk to on the phone, and post my lonelygirl15 video responses to gootube.  (I kid because I love.)  What I really want, though, is a Windows version of the [Gawker app](http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Information.html), the one that makes cool time lapse movies.  Now that would be engaging media.
