David Hornik has a [wrap up of Yahoo Hack Day](http://p6.hostingprod.com/@www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2006/001258.html).Â  "The fact that Yahoo embraced engineers from startups and design shops throughout the ecosystem is indicative of the sort of coopetition that is going on around the web these days."
