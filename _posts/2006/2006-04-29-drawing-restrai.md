Oooh, looking forward to this: [Matthew Barney: DRAWING RESTRAINT](http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/exhib_detail.asp?id=230 "SFMOMA | Exhibitions | Exhibition Overview: Matthew Barney"), June 23 to September 17 at the SFMOMA.

> SFMOMA is the only U.S. venue for this full-scale survey, the first to gather together Matthew Barney’s entire DRAWING RESTRAINT series. Spanning almost 20 years, DRAWING RESTRAINT is an ongoing, performance-based project exploring the notion that form emerges through struggle against resistance. .... A site-specific installation designed by the artist, the exhibition occupies the Museum’s entire fourth floor, which has been reconfigured to eliminate the gallery walls

Unfortunatley it looks like his talk on June 22 is already sold out... Anyone have a spare ticket?
