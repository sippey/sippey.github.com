The Chronicle [covers the sale of Cody's to Yohan, Inc.](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/09/BUGNTL26MA1.DTL), the Japanese book distributor.  In it, there's a sad quote from Andy Ross about his surprise to San Francisco's reaction to the Cody's that opened in the city...

> "I thought we would just open the doors (in San Francisco) and everyone would pour in. That was pretty stupid. Cody's was so well-branded in Berkeley that I took it for granted, but still there are a lot of people in San Francisco who don't know that the store exists."

Just like the micro-climates, there are micro-markets in the Bay Area.  This shouldn't have been news to him...  But at least there's a decent ending in this for Cody's, and the 4th Street store is still one of my favorite places to buy books.
