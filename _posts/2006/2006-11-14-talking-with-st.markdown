<p>Yesterday Anil and I had the distinct pleasure of talking with Steven Johnson for our podcast series at <a href="http://books.typepad.com/">books.typepad.com</a>.&nbsp; As the kids say, <strong>[this is good]</strong>.&nbsp; Take a listen, and forgive us our bumper, as we forgive those who've bumpered against us.</p>
