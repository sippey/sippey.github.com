We've got a lot of great things coming out of Six Apart lately, but one that's gone unheralded is Harold Check's daily masterpiece, [Featured TypePad Blogs](http://featured.typepad.com/).  It's the simple formula that made his [Media Nugget](http://www.medianugget.com/) one of my favorite pre-Web 2.0 properties:  100 words, a screenshot and a link.  People keep asking us "what are some great blogs I should be reading," and now we have answers.  An ongoing stream of answers in fact.
