Finally, something other than Google in fifty years, or [swearing](http://store.muledesign.com/shirts/omg.php) in IM.

Four jobs I've had:

1.  Truck mechanic's assistant.  Worked on 18-wheelers.  Changed tires, changed oil, pulled out clutches.
2.  Production assistant for a TV studio.  Ran tapes, fetched food, learned just how malleable television is.
3.  Newspaper distributor.  Fancy word for delivery boy, but I owned distribution of the NYTimes in Hamilton, NY during college.
4.  Professional blog person.

Four movies I could watch over and over:

1.  Godfather 1
2.  Godfather 2
3.  Annie Hall
4.  Grosse Pointe Blank

Four places I've lived:

1.  Clayton, MO
2.  Wallingford, PA
3.  Hamilton, NY
4.  San Francisco Bay Area

Four TV shows I love:

1.  Lost
2.  The Office
3.  The Sopranos
4.  24

Four places I've vacationed:

1.  Paris (honeymoon)
2.  Hawaii (before the first kid)
3.  A weekend in Sonoma County (between the first and second kids)
4.  Disneyland (after the second kid...see a trend?)

Four of my favorite dishes:

1.  Kow Soi yellow curry with chicken from the Thai place down the street.
2.  Anything from Sea Salt in Berkeley
3.  Fried green beans from Bizou Coco 500
4.  Honey nut Cheerios

Four places I would rather be right now

1.  Home with the girls
2.  New York
3.  Kauai
4.  On the Dipsea trail, but only if it were sunny out.
