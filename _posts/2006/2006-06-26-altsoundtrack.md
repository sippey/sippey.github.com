The Times has a great [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/movies/25jame.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1151359800-EHNh45px5wFDpOe41yC/9Q "www.nytimes.com") about Kevin Smith and the upcoming _Clerks II,_ including this little tidbit about what he's doing with director commentary...

> In an ingenious new ploy, he has recorded a commentary for "Clerks II" that will be available for free download on iTunes, encouraging viewers to take their iPods to the theater for a second viewing.

Brilliant.  Multiple viewings, reward your best fans, etc., etc.  Why hasn't this been done before?
