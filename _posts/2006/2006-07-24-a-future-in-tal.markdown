I'm not about to quit my day job, but I must admit that doing today's [Skypecast with Chris Anderson](http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2006/07/chat_with_chris.html) (in case you haven't heard, he's written this [pretty popular book](http://www.thelongtail.com/)) was a ton of fun.  We had about 50 people on the call, and I think juggling the questions from the participants with my own list of layups insightful, probing questions worked out pretty well. Of course, Chris will probably never speak to me again, and the folks on the call were probably hoping for a more "head of the tail" type host...
