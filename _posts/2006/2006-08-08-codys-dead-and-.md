Cody's Books on Telegraph Avenue closed last month, causing untold numbers of hands in Berkeley to wring with self-righteous indignation at the heartless march of capitalism, the encroachment of mega-onliners like Amazon and the decline and fall of literacy in west coast civilization. 

There's been plenty of press coverage of the Berkeley icon's closing; Anneli Rufus' [long and thoughtful piece in the _East Bay Express_](http://www.eastbayexpress.com/Issues/2006-08-02/news/feature_full.html) is the best one I've read yet.  She covers the sturm and drang of the demise of Cody's with just the right amount of gentle skewering...

> When Berkeley looks in the mirror, it perceives a book town, a lit-cred Lourdes linked with so many bards and rebels and laureates alive and dead that reciting their bibliographies would take all day. Not just uninflected authors but, to a large part, activist authors with a cause. Rare is any city so spellbound by its own legacy. For better or worse, Berkeley is a living theme park, forever conjuring a heyday that Cody's crystallized. "Tie-dyed Tears," one blogger proclaimed.

Worth reading if you spent money at Cody's, have ever stepped foot on Telegraph Ave., or have an interest in retail bookselling...
