Ethan Zuckerman has a [great overview](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004543.html) of the progress the "One Laptop per Child" project is making on designing an inexpensive laptop that's perfect for kids.

> Most of the people who write me are interested in owning a laptop they can afford. And that, it turns out, is not the goal of the One Laptop Per Child project. Their goal is to produce a laptop designed for use by children - students in grades K-12. And that requires radically different design decisions than what one would make in simply creating a low-cost laptop.

Worth reading, especially for the description of the challenges of adding a crank for human-generated power, and how they're thinking of integrating [Logowiki](http://www.logowiki.net/) on to the device... (Logo == fun! I always think of [Processing](http://www.processing.org/) as logo for grownups.)
