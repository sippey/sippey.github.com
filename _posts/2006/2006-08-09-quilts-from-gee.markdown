 Everyone I've talked to that's seen <a href="http://www.thinker.org/deyoung/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?exhibitionkey=549">The Quilts of Gee's Bend</a> exhibition at the (new) de Young has been blown away.&nbsp; But not everyone knows that the de Young isn't the only place for hot quilting action in the Bay Area this summer. </p>

<p>First, the Haines Gallery has <a href="http://www.hainesgallery.com/Main_Pages/Artist_Pages/GBEN.work.html">an exhibit</a> of Gee's Bend Quilts up through August 26; Haines is on the tpo floor of the 49 Geary <del>art mall</del> building near Union Square

</p>

<p>And two of the artists from Gee's Bend -- <a href="http://www.paulsonpress.com/BendolphL/Bendolph_gallery.html">Lousiana Bendolph</a> and <a href="http://www.paulsonpress.com/BendolphM/Bendolph_gallery.html">Mary Lee Bendolph</a> have made prints with Berkeley's <a href="http://www.paulsonpress.com/">Paulson Press</a>.&nbsp; Paulson's closed for the month of August, but both the de Young and Haines exhibits are showing prints from their project.&nbsp; <em>(Self-important blogger disclaimer -- the Paulson folks are friends, and my wife used to work closely with them.)</em></p>



<p>As the kids are saying on <a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a>, <strong>[this is good]</strong>.</p>
