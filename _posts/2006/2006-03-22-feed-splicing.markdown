So I'm kvetching to a friend in IM how there aren't really any user-friendly [tools](http://btrott.typepad.com/typepad/2005/08/the_joy_of_spli.html) out there for feed splicing (and how both the [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/getitems) and [Newsgator APIs](http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/api/Feed.aspx) should break out of the feed-by-feed mode).  How is this remix cultcha supposed to happen without things that make it easy to remix?

And then literally less than an hour later I find out about the new ["share" feature in Google Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/03/reader-learns-to-share.html), which will output recent items from a labeled set of feeds (or your starred items) as a styled clip for your site, or as a feed itself.  Voila, user friendly feed splicing.
