Malcolm Gladwell [on](http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/2006/09/degree_of_diffi.html) Michael Lewis's [new book](http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Side-Evolution-Game/dp/039306123X/)...

> The degree of difficulty on telling the story of Michael Oher was really really high. Trust me. It was. It was all that I could think of when I was reading the book. ... And if you don't believe me, just try writing an emotionally moving. full-length account of an essentially pathologically shy, inarticulate teenager.
