Haven't seen the book, but I have to applaud the title:Â  _[Designing the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web Application Design](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Obvious-Approach-Application-Design/dp/032145345X/sr=8-1/qid=1161460004/ref=sr_1_1/104-0546780-9700709?ie=UTF8&s=books "Amazon.com: Designing the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web Application Design: Books: Robert Hoekman Jr.")_.
