Someone better add this to You Tube:  the clip from tonight's _Daily Show_ when Ed Helms managed to lure [Mark Crispin Miller](http://markcrispinmiller.blogspot.com/) into an argument over whether Oscar the Grouch eats plastic bottles.  There was this perfect moment when Miller snapped out of his 15-minute induced haze and realized just how foolish he must look countering Helms' argument that Oscar could in fact replace the trash collection service in [Dish, Texas](http://www.google.com/search?q=dish+texas).

Quick, someone order me a copy of _[Boxed In:  The Culture of Television](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810107929/statingtheobviou)_.  Must be a _fantastic_ read.
