Jon Fine's [column](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_37/b4000039.htm) in the Sept 11 issue of Business Week is on Bree & Daniel and the series of [lonelygirl15](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=lonelygirl15) videos.

> Based on comments from media and talent agency executives, the videos appear to be produced by a small coterie of creative types. They have had discussions with at least one major media company. Agents are pursuing them as well.

So wait..they _appear_ to be produced by creative types...yet they've had discussions with at least one major media company?  Fine's being a bit cute, no?  I agree with him, though, that this is the best bit of summer TV around.  The "who is lonelygirl15" saga makes The Lost Experience seem ridiculously contrived and overblown...  Alvar [who](http://lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Hanso_Foundation)?
