[![Logitech](https://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/images/logitech.jpg "Logitech")](http://sippey.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/logitech.jpg) Just spent about 30 minutes trying to get a Logitech webcam we had lying around the office to work with my Thinkpad.  Couldn't make it work, and gave up after I realized that I spent about 29 minutes more than I should have trying to find and install the drivers for the damn thing.  It's late 2006.  **Shouldn't plug and play be a reality by now?**

There was _one_ nice touch in this otherwise incredibly frustrating experience -- Logitech has nice little pictures to help you find the right software for your device. Of course, the package for my cam was a 79mb download (who needs 79 megs of software for a _web cam?_) that didn't work.  But hey, at least their web team got their part of the experience right.
