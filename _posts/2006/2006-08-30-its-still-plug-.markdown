Just spent about 30 minutes trying to get a Logitech webcam we had lying around the office to work with my Thinkpad.&nbsp; Couldn't make it work, and gave up after I realized that I spent about 29 minutes more than I should have trying to find and install the drivers for the damn thing.&nbsp; It's late 2006.&nbsp; <strong>Shouldn't plug and play be a reality by now?</strong></p>

<p>There was <em>one</em> nice touch in this otherwise incredibly frustrating experience -- Logitech has nice little pictures to help you find the right software for your device. Of course, the package for my cam was a 79mb download (who needs 79 megs of software for a <em>web cam?</em>) that didn't work.&nbsp; But hey, at least their web team got their part of the experience right.</p>
