I don't have much to add to the "Google Office" discussion, except to add this note to [Chris Anderson's plea](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/08/google_apps_and.html) for the ability to embed spreadsheets in pages like you can embed YouTube videos.Â  We've actually had these before, courtesy of HalfBrain.com, which I [wrote about](http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1999/12/20.html) back in 1999 during Bubble 1.0.

> Written entirely in DHTML, Brain Matter provides the 20% of the functionality of Excel that 80% of the market uses 100% of the time -- all in your browser. It's fast, it's clean, it's intuitive -- and it's smart. HalfBrain clearly knows that when you migrate an application to the network, it opens up new ways to use that application. First, they've enabled network-based storage of the spreadsheets you create (of course). Second, their site helps shift focus from the tool itself to the _use_ of the tool, by publishing more than 200 interactive calculators that help users do simple tasks like track expenses, plan a party or calculate the value of their options. Finally, they've flipped the viral bit, making it incredibly easy to email a spreadsheet to a friend, or to post a calculator on your own website.

The folks behind HalfBrain ended up doing a little thing called Oddpost, and you know the rest of that [story](http://mail.yahoo.com/)...
