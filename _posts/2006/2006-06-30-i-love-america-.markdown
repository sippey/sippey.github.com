This is the first Bush story this year that's made me smile:  The Times [recaps](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/30/world/asia/30cnd-elvis.html?hp&ex=1151726400&en=8fdb46352ffa6481&ei=5094&partner=homepage "www.nytimes.com") the his visit to Graceland with Koizumi:

> When Lisa Marie Presley showed the prime minister her father's trademark sunglasses, he promptly donned them and thrust his hips and arms forward, an earnest imitation of a classic Elvis stage move.

And this gem:

> One part of the house that they were not to visit is the upstairs, Elvis's living quarters, which the King of Rock 'n' Roll insisted remain private.  "Nobody goes upstairs," Mr. Beckwith said.

I can just imagine the two of them peering up the stairs to the second floor, craning their necks to see if they can get a view of the bathroom where Elivs died...  Poetic, almost.
