And there was much rejoicing, for today marks the return of [Dirk](http://interconnected.org/dirk/), which celebrates the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.  Soooooper genius Matt Webb [writes](http://interconnected.org/home/2006/08/24/dirk_is_back)...

> I've rewritten Dirk for my own learning a few times, in Perl again, PHP and Python. It's my Hello World app, hitting web apps, databases, general syntax, algorithms and performance. I try to write it as idiomatically as possible each time, and squeezing every drop of performance out of the pathfinding algorithm (which I know pretty well by now) lets me learn what's fast and slow in each language.

Dirk is one hell of a Hello World app.  Go play!  Connect!  Pathfind!
