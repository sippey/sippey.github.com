...and _thank God_ for that.  I'm hoping that NBC either (a) deliberately [leaked this to YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJPkNiP_As) or (b) has enough smarts to let this stay up there and drive interest in the new show.  It's worth the 10 minutes out of your day...

**Update:** it's now gone, daddy, gone.  You'll have to wait for the real thing to see Judd Nelson do his _Network_ thing so well.  I'm hoping that even without HD you'll be able to see a vein pulse in his head...
