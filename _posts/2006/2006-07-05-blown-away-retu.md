Maxell is bringing back the "blown away" guy -- the classic image of the guy in the chair. All the details in this [Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/media/05adco.html "www.nytimes.com"), including details about the original photo shoot.

> "Layers of hairspray held the model's hair in wind-blown position and some strands were tied to the ceiling" with fine fishing line, the article reported. The fishing line was also used on the lamp shade and cord in the photograph, to make it seem as if they, too, were being buffeted by the force of the music.

Ahh, Madison Avenue.  Next up -- the Gorilla in the cage with the Samsonite luggage.  Or has that one already been resurrected?
