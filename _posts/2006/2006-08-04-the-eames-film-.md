You've bought the furniture...now see the movies!  Design Within Reach is putting on an [Eames Film Festival](http://www.dwr.com/eamesfilms.cfm) in their stores around the country.  Brilliant marketing move; further associate the DWR brand with Eames, and drive a slew of design geeks into the stores.  I'm sure the one in SF will be packed, especially since there will be a presentation from one of the grandchildren.

I've only seen Powers of Ten (and have watched [The Simpsons homage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCfDRvDWid0) probably two dozen times on YouTube with my daughter); would love to see the others.  Turns out you can buy [a box set of the Eames films](http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B0009S2K92/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/) for about $70.  The experience of which would definitely be enhanced in the comfort of the [lounge chair and ottoman set](http://www.dwr.com/productdetail.cfm?id=9100).

(NB -- All my favorite design-y type blogs have posted about this today; I wonder how many learned about it from DWR's nicely done (if just a bit too frequently delivered) email newsletter?)
