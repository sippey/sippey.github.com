I can't stand the comments and the posts are only moderately interesting, but what's still entertaining about Slashdot (after all these years) are the departments.  As in the story about [Kenneth Lay's death](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/07/05/1557222.shtml) coming from the _so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-sarbox_ dept.  So please, won't someone construct me a custom feed that mashes the title of the item and the department it comes from into one long title for quick and easy LiveBookmarks or Google Toolbar scanning?  Heck, their feed already has the custom <slash:department> namespace you'd need; it almost transforms itself.\[1\]

\[1\] Dear God (a separate entity from the Lazyweb, to be sure), please shoot me.  I made an XSLT joke.  In a post about Slashdot.
