Where I grew up, Christmas season didn't start the day after Halloween, nor did it start the day after Thanksgiving. It started on December 1st - the day the Advent Calendar went up on the wall, and we could start counting down the days by peeling back a little bit of cardboard every morning.

Today the unstoppable Leslie Harpold kicks off [Advent Calendar 2006](http://www.harpold.com/advent/), where each day from now until the 25th you get "a Christmas memory, a holiday link and something special."Â  Mind you, this is no auto-posted template-driven affair; each day's entry is a lovingly hand-crafted and custom-designed thing of beauty. Want proof? This is the Leslie's sixth year of online Advent Calendars; after you've peeled back [today's](http://www.harpold.com/advent/01.html), revisit December 1sts from [2005](http://www.harpold.com/advent2005/01.html), [2004](http://www.harpold.com/advent2004/01.html), [2003](http://www.harpold.com/advent2003/01.html), [2002](http://www.harpold.com/advent2002/01.html) and [2001](http://www.harpold.com/advent2001/01.html).
