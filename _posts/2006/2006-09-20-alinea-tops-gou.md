Congrats to Grant Aschatz and my friend Nick Kokonas of Chicago's [Alinea](http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/) for topping Gourmet's list of the 50 best restaurants in America (via [Megnut](http://www.megnut.com/2006/09/gourmet-names-alinea-number-one)).

I had the privilege of eating there this summer _(eating's not really the right word for it...and I've been called pretentious but I'm not quite pretentious enough to use the verb "to dine")_, and enjoyed _(again...with Alinea "experienced" is probably the better word)_ the best meal of my life.Â  And then the next day Nick and I grabbed lunch and he told the greatest stories about meeting Chef Aschatz, lining up investors, renovating the building\[1\], marketing the concept, etc. I couldn't be happier for Nick and crew -- they've built something truly amazing in an incredibly short period of time.

\[1\] If you ever meet Nick, ask him to tell you the story of how he tiled the entryway basement of the restaurant himself in one all-nighter, just to show his contractor that "this is what it means to get shit done."
