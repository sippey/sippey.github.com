Robin Sloan, in [The slab and the permacomputer](https://society.robinsloan.com/archive/slab/), puts a finger on what makes deploying a contract to the Ethereum blockchain feel so…different.

> _Even so, I can’t deny that Ethereum’s “world computer” is interesting and, even more than that, evocative. The Ethereum blockchain is one entity, shared globally, agreed upon by all its participants: that’s what makes it useful as a ledger. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, a kind of computer — simultaneously sophisticated and primitive — is likewise one logical entity, even if it’s distributed in space and time._

> _As with a lot of things in crypto, the feeling is as much mystical as it is technical. I understand why people get excited when they deploy an Ethereum contract: it feels like you are programming not just a computer, but THE computer. That feeling is technically wrong; it is definitely just a computer; but since when did the technical wrongness of feelings prevent them from being motivating?_

One of the “mystical” Web3 things that is delightfully breaking my brain is that the EVM is forcing us ask the question (again): **What’s a computer?**
