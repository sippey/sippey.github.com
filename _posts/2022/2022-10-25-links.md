[Matt Levine: The Crypto Story](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/). A must read multi-thousand word almost-daily newsletter isn't enough? The guy needs to write 40,000 words on crypto? From his newsletter: "If you are a crypto expert you will probably hate this because I skipped over or slighted your favorite things. If you are a crypto hater you will probably hate this because, you know, itâ€™s 40,000 words about crypto."

[Updates to the App Store Rules](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=xk8d7p8c). 3.1.1 feels like cutting off experimentation and creativity before things even get started: "Apps may allow users to view their own NFTs, provided that NFT ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app." And 3.1.3(g) feels like a massive overreach: "Digital purchases for content that is experienced or consumed in an app, including buying advertisements to display in the same app (such as sales of 'boosts' for posts in a social media app) must use in-app purchase."

[Andrew Hill: The Best Business Books of 2022](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/best-business-books-2022-andrew-hill/). Hill is the *Financial Times'* senior business writer, and he shortlists this year's crop for the always interesting [Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/). *[Dead in the Water: A True Story of Hijacking, Murder, and a Global Maritime Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593329236)* sounds amazing.
