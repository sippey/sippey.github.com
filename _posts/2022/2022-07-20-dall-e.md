Super interesting [pricing model](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-now-available-in-beta/) from OpenAI for DALL•E. Each image request is costs one credit; you get 50 free credits your first month, and 15 free credits every month after that. Buying 115 credits costs $15, and can be shared across an organization. Also, this:

> Starting today, users get full usage rights to commercialize the images they create with DALL·E, including the right to reprint, sell, and merchandise. This includes images they generated during the research preview.

I think we're going to see a *lot* of competition in this space, and a bunch of creativity around different types of asset generation with different constraints on the input training set, different pricing models, different target audiences, etc. Weird times ahead. Also, it might be time to check out the [DALL•E 2 prompt book](https://dallery.gallery/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-DALL%C2%B7E-2-prompt-book.pdf), an 85 page guide on how to craft useful prompts for the [big image making machine in the sky](/assets/2022/2022-07-20-dalle.png).
