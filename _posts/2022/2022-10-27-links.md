[Charles Gaines: The American Manifest, Moving Chains](https://creativetime.org/american-manifest-part-two/), "a monumental 110-foot long kinetic sculpture that evokes the hull of a ship, built from steel and Sapele, a tree native to West Africa commonly referred to as African Mahogany. Inside of the sculpture, nine chains run overhead: rotating on a maritime sprocket system, eight of the chains represent the pace of the currents in New York Harbor, while a ninth central chain moves more quickly, mimicking the pace of a ship in transit."

[Matt Webb: Let me recruit AI teammates into Figma](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/26/teammates). "Perhaps app features should be ownable and tradable. A pocketful of feature flags. In short: instead of having thousands of features, mostly unused, undiscovered in a thousand menus, you would see a colleague using a feature in a multiplayer app (like an editing feature in a doc, or co-presenter in Zoom), and thenâ€¦ they could just give it to you. (Or you could buy it.)" 

[Semantle](https://semantle.com/), which I wish I had never heard of.
