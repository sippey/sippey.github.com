[Elisa Gonzalez at The Paris Review on Marilyn Monroe's poetry](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2022/06/28/marilyn-monroes-poetry/). "Marilyn often spent long periods in front of the mirror, just looking at herself. This wasn’t only the rapture of narcissism. She studied and honed her movements and faces, learning to *feel* how she *looked* in the eyes of others. Especially given that Marilyn never sought publication, reading her work makes me think less of overhearing a conversation than of watching someone else’s shifting reflection. These dashed-off, insular poems embody an oft-submerged but ever-present feature of lyric poetry: a dialogue within the self, overheard by the self."

[Olivia Snow, in Wired: Are You Ready to Be Surveilled Like a Sex Worker](https://www.wired.com/story/roe-abortion-sex-worker-policy/)? "Some precautions I’ve taken for my own safety as a sex worker include withholding my birthday, age, ethnic background, hometown, current city, former cities, commute, alma maters, graduation years, time zone, weather, current employers, past employers, even my favorite color. When I post photos, I photoshop out my face and tattoos, and I never reveal my natural hair. If I post a screenshot, I crop out any time stamps."

[John Gruber: How to Temporarily Disable Face ID or Touch ID, and Require a Passcode to Unlock Your iPhone or iPad](https://daringfireball.net/2022/06/require_a_passcode_to_unlock_your_iphone). "Just press and hold the buttons on both sides. Remember that. Try it now. Don’t just memorize it, internalize it, so that you’ll be able to do it without much thought while under duress, like if you’re confronted by a police officer. Remember to do this every time you’re separated from your phone, like when going through the magnetometer at any security checkpoint, especially airports. As soon as you see a metal detector ahead of you, you should think, 'Hard-lock my iPhone'."
