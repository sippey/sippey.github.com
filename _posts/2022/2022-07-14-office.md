I love working from home, but I also love all the friends I've made working in offices over the years. In other words I love not commuting, but I miss...humans. A lot. This piece from Emma Goldman in the New York Times, "[The Magic of Your First Work Friends](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/business/work-friends.html)," is hitting me hard today...

> There’s an electricity to forming that first close friend at work. It’s the thrill of staying too late at drinks to keep giggling. It’s the delight of darting to someone’s desk and dragging her to the bathroom to gossip. It’s the tenderness of showing up to work on a rough morning and realizing a co-worker will know instantly that something is wrong.

I wrote a thing back in 2015, titled [TFW, office edition](https://sippey.com/2015/10/08/tfw-office-edition.html) that I'm still really proud of, despite its dated reference to email threads. It's essentially a love letter to my first work friends. Here's a graf related to the one above...

> That feeling when you’re running late on a Friday morning, having had maybe a few too many the night before with your work crew, and it took you longer than usual to find parking and the elevator’s late and you’re hustling to your desk because you’re worried the CEO is going to look at you askance and wonder where the hell you’ve been and you get there and she’s not in yet.

Good times.
