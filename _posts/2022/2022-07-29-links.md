[Rands on Elden Ring](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/dont-panic/). I am not a gamer, but I enjoy reading Michael Lopp on pretty much anything, especially things that he *loves*. "The fundamental lesson in Elden Ring is a reminder: **donâ€™t panic**. Yes, the hideous crow-like creature is ten times larger than you, it makes horrific noises designed to terrify you, but this creature in this game is a knowable machine. It acts in an almost predictable manner. Your job in this game is to discover the pattern and to use it against this creature. It is a scenario designed to get your heart rate up, but the winning strategy starts with a lesson that is always useful: you are your worst self when you panic."

[Notable People](https://tjukanovt.github.io/notable-people). "Using data from Morgane Laouenan et al., the map is showing birthplaces of the most 'notable people' around the world. Data has been processed to show only one person for each unique geographic location with the highest notability rank." Love this. (Via [Waxy](https://waxy.org/).)

[Why is this interesting, the Tetris edition](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-tetris-edition). I had no idea that people played Tetris with the "hypertapping" technique. Wild.
