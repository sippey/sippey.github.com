[Instagram, TikTok, and the Three Trends](https://stratechery.com/2022/instagram-tiktok-and-the-three-trends/). Sometimes (OK, a lot of times) Ben Thompson nails it. This one of his nails it. (Also, only 11% of the text is self-quoting!) "There is lots of talk about the $10 billion the company is spending on the Metaverse, but that is R&amp;D; the more important number for this moat is the $30 billion this year in capital expditures, most of which is going to servers for AI. That AI is doing recommendations now, but Metaâ€™s moat will only deepen if Lessin is right about a future where creators can be taken out of the equation entirely, in favor of artificially-generated content." (*Westworld*, anyone?)
