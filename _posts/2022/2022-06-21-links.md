[Fred Wilson: Staying Positive](https://avc.com/2022/06/staying-positive-2/). "Yes, it is our collective fault for getting out over our skis during the good times and not seeing tougher times ahead. Yes, we could have and should have been more conservative with our growth plans and hiring. Yes, it is our fault for putting our companies in the position where they have to let go of so many people. But it is also the case that the number one thing in times like this is staying in the game so you can play another round." Reminder that we're playing an infinite game.

[James Carse: Finite and Infinite Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). "Infinite players look forward, not to a victory in which the past will achieve a timeless meaning, but toward ongoing play in which the past will require constant reinterpretation. Infinite players do not oppose the actions of others, but initiate actions of their own in such a way that others will respond by initiating their own." (Ahhh, I love [Readwise](https://readwise.io).)
