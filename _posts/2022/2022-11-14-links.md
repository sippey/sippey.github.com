[Ben Thompson: Narratives](https://stratechery.com/2022/narratives/). Two bits from this. First...

> When it comes to the good of humanity, I think the biggest learning from Twitter is that putting together people who disagree with each other is actually a terrible idea; yes, it is why Twitter will never be replicated, but also why it has likely been a net negative for society. The digital town square is the Internet broadly; Twitter is more akin to a digital cage match, perhaps best monetized on a pay-per-view basis."

Note that @benthompson and @notechben are still active as of this afternoon. Despite that "whichever way the wind blows" opening section about Twitter, it's worth reading through the self-quoting all the way to the end, for this...

> In the end, the best way of knowing is starting by consciously not-knowing. Narratives are tempting but too often they are wrong, a diversion, or based on theory without any tether to reality. Narratives that are right, on the other hand, follow from products, which means that if you want to control the narrative in the long run, you have to build the product first, whether that be a software product, a publication, or a company.

Yep.

Sort of related, [I finally read that "savior complex" piece of...content](https://archive.ph/2022.11.10-002447/https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/). The kicker is a wild ride...

> Crypto is money that can audit itself, no accountant or bookkeeper needed, and thus a financial system with the blockchain built in can, in theory, cut out most of the financial middlemen, to the advantage of all. Of course, that’s the pitch of every crypto company out there. The FTX competitive advantage? Ethical behavior. SBF is a Peter Singer–inspired utilitarian in a sea of Robert Nozick–inspired libertarians. He’s an ethical maximalist in an industry that’s overwhelmingly populated with ethical minimalists. I’m a Nozick man myself, but I know who I’d rather trust my money with: SBF, hands-down. And if he does end up saving the world as a side effect of being my banker, all the better.

[SleepBaseball.com](https://www.sleepbaseball.com/). "Northwoods Baseball Sleep Radio is a full-length fake baseball game. There is no yelling, no loud commercials, no weird volume spikes." Haven't tried this. Available wherever you get your podcasts, which means you can listen to it at 2x speed and fall asleep twice as fast.

[A secretive spaceplane just returned to earth after 2.5 years in orbit](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/13/23456718/space-force-x-37b-spaceplane-returns-two-years-falconsat-8). I'm sorry, what? A secretive *spaceplane*? 

[Brent Simmons: After Twitter](https://inessential.com/2022/11/13/after_twitter). "Everything you might build that had to do with communication, reading and writing and otherwise, was compared to Twitter or somehow in relation to Twitter, even when unasked for, and Twitter was the enormous factor in that equation." Can relate.
