[The Daily Show: Elon Musk, Visionary FutureMan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gy5P45hEN4). Narrated by William Shatner. Don't doubt your vibe.

[NYT: Why Pop’s Biggest Stars Are Staying Put for Long Residencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/arts/music/harry-styles-pop-residencies.html). "In a rebounding touring market, with concert-starved audiences buying tickets in record numbers — and at higher prices than ever — these bookings are deliberate choices by prominent artists to reduce their time on the road and set up shop in far fewer places than they could on a traditional tour." 

[DHH: Let it Slide](https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-slide-9e40f11a) "Letting things slide is not a sign of neglect. It's an acceptance of our finite allotment of time, motivation, skill, and knowledge. It's a recognition that if there are 100,000 things you could do, the difference between getting 8 or 12 things done in a day is not really a 50% increase in productivity, but a rounding error in the grand picture of completion."

[Charles Baudelaire: Be Drunk](https://poets.org/poem/be-drunk). "You have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it—it's the only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk. But on what? Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk."
