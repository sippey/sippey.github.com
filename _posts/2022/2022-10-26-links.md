[David Remnick remembers Peter Schjeldahl](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/postscript/10/31/remembering-peter-schjeldahl-a-consummate-critic). "He took his work seriously—despite the cascades of self-deprecation, there were times when I think he knew how good he was—but he was never self-serious. He once won a grant to write a memoir. He used the money to buy a tractor."

[Schjeldahl: The Art of Dying](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/the-art-of-dying-peter-schjeldahl):

> One drunken night, a superb painter let me take a brush to a canvas that she said she was abandoning. I tried to continue a simple black stroke that she had started. The contrast between the controlled pressure of her touch and my flaccid smear shocked me, physically. It was like shaking hands with a small person who flips you across a room.

And...

> I like to say that contemporary art consists of all art works, five thousand years or five minutes old, that physically exist in the present. We look at them with contemporary eyes, the only kinds of eyes that there ever are.

And...

> Life doesn’t go on. It goes nowhere except away. Death goes on. Going on is what death does for a living. The secret to surviving in the universe is to be dead.

[Hot, Cold, Heavy, Light, 100 Art Writings 1988-2018](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419734385/) from Schjeldahl is an incredible collection of criticism. Charles Finch, in his [review of the book in the Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/books/review/hot-cold-heavy-light-peter-schjeldahl.html), said "Schjeldahl seems to find in art the unmediated experiences of living — humor, anger, sadness, perplexity, beauty, sex." Yes. That. And Finch quotes this from the book's essay on Picasso...

> People make the mistake of supposing that genius is complicated. It is the opposite. We regular folks are complicated — tied in knots of ambivalence and befogged with uncertainties. Genius has the economy of a machine with a minimum of moving parts. Everything about Picasso came to bear when he drew a line.
