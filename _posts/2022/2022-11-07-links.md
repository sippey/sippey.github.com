[Gordon Brander on "Thinking Together" and how we've hit an information scaling threshold](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/thinking-together) "The cost of forking realities has dropped below the Coasean floor, and there’s little incentive to merge realities. We fractally fragment understandings, then algorithmically amplify the confusion to maximize engagement. The most effective coordination mechanisms left seem to be memes and conspiracy theories."

[Dave Troy: Elon and Jack are not “competitors.” They’re collaborating](https://davetroy.medium.com/no-elon-and-jack-are-not-competitors-theyre-collaborating-3e88cde5267d). The absolute hottest of takes, in the form of a FAQ. "Q: So this is why Musk seemingly 'overpaid' for Twitter? He and his backers want to use it as a tool of information warfare, to kill off the dollar and help usher in Putin’s 'multipolar world?'"

[Screenplays.io](https://screenplays.io/) is amazing. Here's [*Better Call Saul*, Season 6 Episode 7](https://f004.backblazeb2.com/file/screenplays/posts/better-call-saul-2018/episodes/Better%20Call%20Saul%20607%20-%20Production%20-%20Jul%2012%202021.pdf). "Lalo peels off the waders, revealing his usual clothes underneath. He wipes his hands with a towel, then slips on a pair of FLIP-FLOPS (even though we may glimpse his LOAFERS, along with a coat and a bag of other clothes, inside the trunk)." I need to start reading more screenplays, if only for the [all caps props](https://medium.com/@alli_unger/6-things-to-capitalize-in-your-screenplay-a445e0678aa3).
