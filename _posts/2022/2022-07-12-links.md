[Ev Williams: New Decade, New Ideas](https://ev.medium.com/new-decade-new-ideas-faee8e712589). "Outside of lots of time with friends and family, I plan to spend the next few months (or years) learning as much as I can about things I don’t know a lot about. I also plan to start a new holding company/research lab to facilitate this learning, to be helpful to Medium and other companies I believe in, and to keep doing what I’ve always found most interesting — opening doors to the adjacent possible." I couldn't be happier for this guy.

[Vulture interviews The Bear's Jeremy Allen White](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-bear-jeremy-allen-white-carmy-interview.html). "Something I talked to Joanna and Chris about is, what’s Carmy’s life outside of the kitchen? I don’t think it’s there. That is so heartbreaking. What a lonely place to be in, when you can really only feel like yourself when you’re in your place of work — and now that he’s in this place of work where nothing is working the way he thinks it should be, where is the space for him? That’s why it’s so easy to get angry."
