Taking inspiration from Merlin Mann's fantastic [43 Folders](http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/ "A bunch of tricks, hacks & other cool stuff."), here's a quick hint for those of you who are just dying to use John Gruber's Markdown (the script version, not the MT plugin version, though use of it there is [obviously encouraged](http://www.movabletype.org/developers_contest_plugin_pack_2004.shtml)) on **Windows**.

I assume, of course, that if you're looking to use Markdown on Windows, you've taken the first important step and installed [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) in order to afford yourself a proper bash environment and a local install of Perl. (If not, well, go do that first and come back here later.) If you're already there, then all you need to do is...

1.  [Download Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and unzip it to a directory of your choice. Mine is dumped into _~/stuff/bin_.
    
2.  Launch your Cygwin shell. Make sure that your Cygwin install has _getclip_ and _putclip_ installed (they should be in your /usr/bin). These little utilities give Cygwin access to the Windows clipboard.
    
3.  Open up a text editor, write some text in Markdown [syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Copy it to your clipboard.
    
4.  Alt-tab over to your Cygwin shell and type the command _getclip | /path/to/your/Markdown.pl | putclip_. This should (silently) get the contents of your Windows clipboard, pipe it through Markdown, and put it back out to your clipboard.
    
5.  Alt-tab over to your text editor, hit CTRL-V, and enjoy properly marked-down text.
    

For speed, edit your .bashrc (or equivalent) to create an alias for that command up there to something easier to remember, and faster to type.

Enjoy.
