Here's a Gmail idea: a bookmarklet to "send this page to my Gmail account." This could enable searchable storage of pages of interest -- not blogging links, but providing a way to keep pages that you need to store (transaction confirmations) or search personally. Optionally the user should be able to (a) pre-assign a label and (b) skip the inbox for pages you're sending into your Gmail account.
