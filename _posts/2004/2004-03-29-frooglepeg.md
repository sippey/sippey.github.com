Dear Lazyweb,

Would someone please build FrooglePEG? Just a little app that hits [froogle.google.com](http://froogle.google.com/), selects from the front page list of "items recently found with Froogle" pulls one of the images returned, and displays them in a never-ending stream? Bonus points for making the speed at which images update configurable by the user.

Why? Why not! Who _wouldn't_ want a real-time glimpse into the [soul of ecommerce](http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=power+wheels+barbie&sampleq=1)?

Best,  
Michael
