<p>So a headline showed up in my aggregator from News.com:  <a href="http://news.com.com/Google+buys+e-mail+software+company/2100-1024_3-5227110.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news">Google Buys E-Mail Software Company</a>, but the story 404s, and searches at News.com turn up nothing.  I know I'm not imagining things, because at least one other person <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/04#When:9:43:51PM">blogged it</a>, and Google News <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&edition=us&ie=UTF-8&q=google+buys+e-mail+software+company&scoring=d">indexed it</a>.  Who'd they buy?  And what happened to the story?</p>

<p><b>Update</b>, in case you're interested.  Google bought Neotonic, but that was old news; the acquisition happened back in April of 2003.  Which is probably why News.com pulled the story.</p>
