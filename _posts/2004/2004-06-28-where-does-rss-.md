A quick thing to note about Apple's preview of [Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/): they're putting the RSS reader in [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/safari.html) instead of Mail.app. It's decisions like these by the major players (Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Google, etc.) that will define the consumer mental model for feed consumption: does RSS augment/improve/replace the messaging experience? Or does RSS augment/improve/replace the browsing experience?
