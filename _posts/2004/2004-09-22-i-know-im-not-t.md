All it takes is one goddamned story about Cat Stevens and I've got [Moon Shadow](http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Cat-Stevens/Moon-Shadow.html) stuck in my head. Quick, someone bring me something cleansing and astringent -- like the [new Green Day](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002OERI0/statingtheobvioua/), perhaps -- before this ear worm eats its way through my brain.
