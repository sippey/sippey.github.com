[![](https://www.flickr.com/photos/253242_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=253242 "photo sharing")From Tom Carden, an interesting use of the Flickr API and [processing](http://processing.org/) to build a composite photo of the last 12 images for the colors of the rainbow, based on photo tags. He's got a live [Java applet](http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/p5/flickr_rainbow2/applet/index.html) too. (Does Flash let you build screen saver apps? Someone should package up a Flickr-saver with user-defined tags. "Hrm, today I feel like [New York](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/newyork/) pictures!")
