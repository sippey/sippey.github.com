<p>Could someone please explain to me exactly why AOL's instant messaging client is currently consuming more than 29 megs of memory?  That's more than the Windows shell.  Two and a half times more than Outlook, which everyone complains is a hog.  And almost five times that of Yahoo's IM client.  That just seems <i>insane</i> to me.  I know system resources are ridiculously cheap these days, but unless AOL's installed a complete peer to peer social software platform on my desktop that they're just waiting to spring on an unsuspecting public, I can't imagine what the heck they're doing with all that memory space...</p>
