Could someone please explain to me exactly why AOL's instant messaging client is currently consuming more than 29 megs of memory? That's more than the Windows shell. Two and a half times more than Outlook, which everyone complains is a hog. And almost five times that of Yahoo's IM client. That just seems _insane_ to me. I know system resources are ridiculously cheap these days, but unless AOL's installed a complete peer to peer social software platform on my desktop that they're just waiting to spring on an unsuspecting public, I can't imagine what the heck they're doing with all that memory space...
