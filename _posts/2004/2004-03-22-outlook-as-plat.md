Anil [nails](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/03/19/outlook_as_a_pl) what's happening with Outlook -- it's a platform, not a product. And I don't think he's even using it in its fully glory, as a client for Exchange and (to a lesser extent) Sharepoint. While everyone's been nattering on about the transformative power of social software, Microsoft's actually been _building_ it, and pushing collaborative tools down into the apps where people live -- Outlook and the rest of the Office suite.
