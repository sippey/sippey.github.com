<p>If I'm a publisher of an RSS 2.0 feed that includes items with enclosure elements that point to audio files, with the intent that these are sync-ed to an iPod or other portable audio player, I'm commonly referred to as a "podcaster."</p>

<p>If I'm a subscriber to / consumer of said feed, what am I?</p>
