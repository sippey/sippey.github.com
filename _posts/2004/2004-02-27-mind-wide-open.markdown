If you haven't already, be sure to pick up a copy of Steven Johnson's [_Mind Wide Open_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743241657/statingtheobvioua/). I finished it a few weeks ago, and the core concepts have been resonating in my head ever since. Also, Johnson did a [great interview](http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?display=day&todayDate=02/26/2004) on Fresh Air which aired yesterday.
