A while back I posted about [declining television viewership](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2003/11/where_are_the_y.html) amongst males aged 18-34. iMedia Connection is [reporting](http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/features/010804c.asp) that the latest "Simultaneous Media Usage Survey" from [BIGresearch](http://www.bigresearch.com/) shows that "the missing demographic is migrating toward instant messaging and the Internet."

Amazing numbers: since August of 2002, 18-24 y/o male television viewership decreased 8.8%. 24-34 y/o male television viewership decreased 12.2%. They're spending more time online than they are watching TV -- 187 minutes v. 160 minutes, respectively. And they're doing it in primetime: more than 40% reported online activity between the hours of 7:30 and 11:00 pm. Joe Pilotta, the VP from BIGresearch, hits it on the head.

> "The Internet requires more involvement plus more of an action orientation, especiallywith gaming on computers," he explains. "Also, TV programming has little to say to this age group."
