Now here's an [interesting product placement matchup](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6656556/):  Aflac and Lemony Snicket.  Not only will Aflac ads contain scenes from the "Series of Unfortunate Events," (get it?) but movie will actually have a scene with the quacking duck...though he won't be squawking the brand name.  Here's Laura Kane, Aflac's veep of corp comm:

> “We think it’s the first time an insurance company's done product placement,” Kane said. “We don't have an actual product; we're selling a promise. We think this takes product placement to a whole new level.”

Indeed, IMDB has the [movie's entry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339291/) correctly listing Gilbert Gottfried as the voice of the Aflac duck.
