From [ComingSoon.net](http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=5759):

> Barry Sonnenfeld has teamed with Cherry Road Films on Don DeLillo's _White Noise_, which he will direct and produce, reports Variety. ... Stephen Schiff adapted the script for _White Noise_, winner of the 1985 National Book Award. Sonnenfeld told the trade that casting would begin immediately. He also hopes the project will regain sole claim over its title, which is shared by an upcoming Michael Keaton thriller from Universal Pictures.

Oh, no. Please, God, no. Barry _Sonnenfeld_? The guy who hasn't done a halfway decent movie since _Get Shorty_? The guy who's responsible for _Men in Black II_? Not to mention Stephen "_Deep End of the Ocean_" Schiff?

I'm praying this gets killed in pre-production. I just don't think I could bear a Sonnenfeld interpretation of _WN_.
