As I'm sure you know by now, your tireless dedication, your boundless energy and your overwhelming passion for all things Orkutish has paid off -- our <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">purple home</a> is back!  Once again, we're free to virtually come together, find common interests, share relevant information, and organize social events!</p>

<p>Yours in connection,<br />
