Wow! Thanks to everyone who participated in the flash mob yesterday outside of the Googleplex -- so sorry I couldn't be there! As I'm sure you know by now, your tireless dedication, your boundless energy and your overwhelming passion for all things Orkutish has paid off -- our [purple home](http://www.orkut.com/) is back! Once again, we're free to virtually come together, find common interests, share relevant information, and organize social events!

Yours in connection,  
Michael (currently connected to 4,567,247 people through 1,458 friends and 674 fans, offering 948 testimonials and participating in 112 communities! w00t!)
