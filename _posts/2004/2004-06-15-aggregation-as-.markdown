Dialing in from the land of unintended benefits, Mark Fletcher of [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) is [offering](http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/000156.html) to help anyone left stranded by the [sudden disappearance](http://allied.blogspot.com/2004_06_13_allied_archive.html#108726528857935905) of Weblogs.com recover their content. Nice.
