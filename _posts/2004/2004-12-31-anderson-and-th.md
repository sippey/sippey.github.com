Aside from the acoustic Bowie [covers](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006JMLI4/statingtheobvioua/) sung in Portugese, the best thing about Wes Anderson's _[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou](http://imdb.com/title/tt0362270/)_ has got to be the set.  The two scenes that make the rounds of the ship -- the tour and then the argument -- left me speechless.  In each of his films Anderson gets more adventurous with the fourth wall; his characters aren't talking directly to the audience, but the set, the Bowie covers and the highly stylized animated fish are each reminders that You're Watching A Movie.
