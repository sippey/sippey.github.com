Banana Republic is doing something very interesting with their [dotcom](http://www.bananarepublic.com/) this holiday season: the entire site has been turned over to gift giving. They cut the product line down to gift items, they swapped in a gift look and feel, and, most drastically, revamped the nav. Product-based nav is out (shirts, sweaters, outerwear, etc.), price-based nav is in (under $50, $50 to $100, above $100, etc.).

I'd love to see the planning that went into this, and the analysis that will come out of it...
