Can't tell you how happy it makes me to learn of [Wonkette](http://www.wonkette.com/). Where the hell have I been these last few weeks? [Ana Marie Cox](http://www.theanticmuse.com/) & Washington insider politics gossipy analysis in an easily digestible format? TriFECTA, ladies and gentelmen.

(Quick moment of idolization: Ana edited the [few pieces](http://www.suck.com/fish/contributors/sippey/bio.html) I wrote for [Suck](http://www.suck.com/). She made them muuuuuuuuch better than they were when they were originally submitted, and used every opportunity to push me to be a better writer. The pieces turned out great. Me and writing? Not so much.)
