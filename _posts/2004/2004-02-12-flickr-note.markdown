Small [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) note. Went to log in this afternoon and instinctively reached for the Win key (to launch an app), instead of the alt-tab combo (to reach for the nearest browser). Those who have spent any amount of time there will recognize the instinct; Flickr is an application _(or insert appropriate terminology here)_ that feels like a "place" instead of a site that acts like a "service." A destination instead of a tool; to be experienced instead of being used. (Of couse Flickr has its roots, literally, in Game Neverending, so the place-ness is part of its lineage...)

Question: Flickr.now begs to be run in full-screen mode; if Flickr.tomorrow is more of a companion app (like an IM client), how would the user mode change?
