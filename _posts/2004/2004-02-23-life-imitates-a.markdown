<p>The New York Times stopped me in my tracks this morning; the front page photo of the skaters in Central Park (cleverly titled "Me and My Human") bears a remarkable resemblance to a print that Bay Area artist Christopher Brown made at <a href="http://www.crownpoint.com/">Crown Point Press</a> in the early 90s.  An image of the exact print I'm thinking of isn't available online, but a similar one from the same time period titled <a href="http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/brownc/79men.html"><i>Seventy-Nine Men</i></a> is.</p>
