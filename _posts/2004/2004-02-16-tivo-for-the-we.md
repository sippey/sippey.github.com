Doc Searls [reports](http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/02/16#liveFromDemo) that [Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com/) demoed something called "NewsDash," with the positioning that "Newsdash does for the Web what TiVo does for television." Why do I get the feeling that a good half dozen companies will be pitching us _exactly_ the same story in the next few months? The Tivo story works for television because the device/service combo transformed the relationship between broadcaster and viewer. I don't buy "Tivo for the web" positioning because the web doesn't need that kind of transformation -- the viewer/reader/clicker is already in a position of control, with a myriad of tools at their fingertips (bookmarks, Google, email, weblogs, aggregators) to find, sort and manage content.
