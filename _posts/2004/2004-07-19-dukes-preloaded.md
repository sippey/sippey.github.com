When I wrote [this piece](http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html) last July, I had visions of Apple pre-loading iPods with demographically targeted music selections. But I _love_ [this story](http://www.appleinsider.com/news.php?id=555): Duke University will be giving away iPods to incoming freshmen preloaded with Duke-related content and couple it with a Duke-specific version of the music store. The folks at Apple are definitely getting creative, leveraging their existing ties to the educational market to push the iPod line.
