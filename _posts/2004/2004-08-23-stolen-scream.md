So the story about the [stolen Scream](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&e=5&u=/washpost/20040823/ts_washpost/a23334_2004aug22) was all over the news last night, but what I had completely forgotten until reading this morning's story in the Post is that this is the second time this piece's been heisted -- last time was in 1994 at the start of the winter Olympics in Lillehammer. You'd think they'd have figured out security by now...

Oh, and how long until The Onion does a piece on having an dot com office worker's [inflatable Scream](http://www.sunshinejoy.com/default.asp?Item=OWINSCR54) punching bag swiped from a little-used conference room?
