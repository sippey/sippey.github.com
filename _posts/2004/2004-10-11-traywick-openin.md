Late last year Traywick Gallery morphed into [Traywick Contemporary](http://www.traywick.com/) when Trina moved her business from her gallery space on Gilman in Berkeley into our house, gracefully making the shift from "retail" to "private" dealer.  We installed flat files, turned a massive closet into art storage, buffed up the home office...and now she's doing just what she did before -- representing her artists and connecting them with collectors -- in a different environment. 

While she's been doing a few private events and artist talk type things at the house, it's not all wine and brie.  Back in March she took over the basement space of [Crown Point Press](http://www.crownpoint.com/) (formerly occupied by the dearly-departed Refusalon) for a month-long show of [Susan Martin's sculpture](http://www.traywick.com/2004/03/susan_martin.html) (reviewed [here](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/03/20/DDGD35NC821.DTL) by Kenneth Baker).  Starting this Thursday the 14th she'll be in the 49 Geary building in downtown San Francisco for five weeks with a show of [Charles LaBelle's compound photographs](http://traywick.com/2004/10/charles_labelle.html). 

If you don't know LaBelle's work, you should.  He takes thousands of photos while traveling, cuts 1 inch square pieces from contact sheets, and assembles them into large (think 3 by 6 foot) tapestries.  They're absolutely stunning.  If you're in San Francisco Thursday night, come by:  5-7 pm, 49 Geary, 5th Floor.  The show runs from Wednesday - Saturday, 11-5 from October 14 through November 20.
