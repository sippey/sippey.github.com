Wow, I guess that whole mini-iPod thing must be a hit -- after all, who wouldn't want to spend just $50 less than a white iPod in order to get a 40% of the storage capacity and _colors_. And I guess the XServe must be the thing for my server farm. After all, that G5 is part of the third-fastest supercomputer in the world!

(I know, pointless bashing. A few reloads later and the site appeared. But, um, oops.)
