See that big red spirally thing hovering over Japan? That's where I am. The rain is unlike anything I've ever seen, but supposedly this typhoon "isn't that bad" since the winds haven't picked up. But my _God_, the rain. Buckets and buckets; the four of us returning from dinner stopped in our tracks to marvel at an alleyway that had become a river.

(Update: I blog weather photos, 'cause my SD slot is on the fritz. Mie blogs [photos and videos](http://kokochi.com/archives/000848.shtml) of the actual event. She gets the prize.)
