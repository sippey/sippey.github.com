While I enjoy a little Bush-bashing as much as the next Berkeley resident (OK, probably not _quite_ as much), [Jeff Jarvis nails](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_01.html#005767) the problem with MoveOn.org's [Bush in 30 Seconds](http://www.bushin30seconds.org/):

> The assignment only extends the problem with liberalism today: It's all about being against. It's all about no. It's all about bad dog, bad. How much better it would have been to assign these creative masses to come up with ads that present a positive view of a better world without Bush and with a vision we can grab onto and support with pride.

So, I'm hoping for v2 of MoveOn's program -- "_insert candidate here_ in 30 seconds."
