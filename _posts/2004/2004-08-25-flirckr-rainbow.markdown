He's got a live <a href="http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/p5/flickr_rainbow2/applet/index.html">Java applet</a> too.  (Does Flash let you build screen saver apps?  Someone should package up a Flickr-saver with user-defined tags.  "Hrm, today I feel like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/newyork/">New York</a> pictures!")</p>
