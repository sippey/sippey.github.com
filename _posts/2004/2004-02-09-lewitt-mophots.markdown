<p>Took a slew of mophotos of the Lewitt wall drawings last week at SFMOMA; even though they're not his best, and they're almost <i>too</i> well integrated into the striped interior architecture of the building, they are still one of my favorite things about the museum.  Somewhere I have photos of the lobby when the Sarah Sze piece <a href="http://www.whileseated.org/archives/000319.shtml">was installed</a>; the juxtaposition of Sze and Lewitt was fantastic...</p>
