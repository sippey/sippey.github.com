Via Curt Gardner's [fantastic site](http://www.perival.com/delillo/), comes [news](http://www.perival.com/delillo/ddarticles.html) of a new piece from Don DeLillo titled "Counterpoint: Three movies, a book and an old photograph" in the latest [Grand Street](http://www.grandstreet.com/).

(But my _God_ don't bother with Grand Street's website. Useless, useless flash with bouncing animated navigation and unreadable text. The only saving grace is that the #1 bookstore in their list of retailers is my local [Black Oak Books](http://www.blackoakbooks.com/). Off to the retailer we go for a single issue purchase, when they could have easily lured us into a subscription and a more profitable (direct) relationship. But I digress... New DeLillo!)
