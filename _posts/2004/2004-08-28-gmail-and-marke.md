Why are marketers so afraid of gmail?

So Al DiGuido, CEO of Bigfoot Interactive, a successful email services agency, had a piece in this week's ClickZ titled [Do You Gmail?](http://www.clickz.com/experts/em_mkt/opt/article.php/3399711 "Do You Gmail?"), in which he advised marketers to consider _refusing to send email to customers with gmail.com addresses_. As DiGuido explains it, the fear is that companies who have spent dear resources on customer acquisition will have their messages delivered alongside contextual ads for competitive products and services.

> A major credit card issuer excels at attracting a particular market segment. Gmail offers that company's envious competitors the opportunity to specifically and efficiently target that issuer's customers with contextual ads. The marketer spent millions growing this segment; should it be protected?

Now, given the overall noise in the market, and the challenging signal/noise ratio in the email channel in particular, one would think that marketers would be looking for any invitation to communicate directly with their customers. How could a marketer even think about disrepecting a customer's choice of email domains by refusing to send them email? If your relationship with your customer is so tenuous that you're worried about contextual text ads inside gmail having a significant impact on your customer lifetime value equation, then maybe you shouldn't be emailing that customer in the first place.
