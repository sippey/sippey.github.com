Billboard's reporting that [Apple will ship iPods preloaded with U2's new record.](http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=musicNews&storyID=6545086 "Music Article | Reuters.com")

Step one of the "[next gen iPod](http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html)" strategy that I mused about in July of last year. Not that anyone with half a brain couldn't have generated that strategy on their own. (And, after all, it's all about execution.)

Anyway. Good stuff.
