Jon Udell [writes about](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/06/04.html) the pending [transition](http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/transition.asp) of the ISBN code from 10 digits to 13 digits on Jan 1 2005. I wonder if a micro-market of ISBN integration consultants has popped up to exploit the opportunity to transition publishers, distributors, libraries and retailers to the new format. I'm imagining a few enterprising Y2K consultants pounding away at legacy databases and implementing middleware to translate the 13 digit code to 10 and back again...
