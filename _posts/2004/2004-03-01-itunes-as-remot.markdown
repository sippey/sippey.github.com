<p>I guess this isn't rocket science, and I know this has been beaten to death by those in the know, but I'm still blown away by Apple's implementation of Rendezvous in both iTunes for the Mac and iTunes for Windows.  I'm across the house from the Mac, running a local version of iTunes on the Windows laptop, pulling music across the wireless network.  No wonder folks like Tivo are all over this technology (with their <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/01/tivo_buys_super.html">purchase</a> of Strangeberry).  </p>

<p>That being said, there was a "duh" moment in turning on music sharing on the Mac; had to know how to configure OS X's built-in firewall to allow access to port 3689 or whatever it was.  Not <i>quite</i> idiot proof, but damn close.</p>
