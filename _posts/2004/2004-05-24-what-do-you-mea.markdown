Dear Mercury News / Realcities,

Why do you insist on telling me that "my email address is not in your records" when I subscribe to receive (and regularly open!) three of your email subscription products? All I want to do is click between [this story](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000676.php) and [this story](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/8743710.htm?1c) without going through yet another poorly designed "log in or register" experience.

In other words, you should invest in a single sign-on system -- the excuse that "our email address database is managed separately," is not an acceptable excuse, _especially since you use email address as the user ID._

Thanks,  
Michael
