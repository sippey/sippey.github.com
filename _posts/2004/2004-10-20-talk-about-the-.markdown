<p>See that big red spirally thing hovering over Japan?  That's where I am.  The rain is unlike anything I've ever seen, but supposedly this typhoon "isn't that bad" since the winds haven't picked up.  But my <em>God</em>, the rain.  Buckets and buckets; the four of us returning from dinner stopped in our tracks to marvel at an alleyway that had become a river.</p>

<p>(Update:  I blog weather photos, 'cause my SD slot is on the fritz.  Mie blogs <a href="http://kokochi.com/archives/000848.shtml">photos and videos</a> of the actual event.  She gets the prize.)</p>

<p>(Update 2:  "isn't that bad" <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/nm/20041021/ts_nm/weather_japan_typhoon_dc">my a**</a>.)  </p>
