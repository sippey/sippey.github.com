How very very blog-rigeur of me, posting something about both Firefox _and_ Gmail. But here's the thing. I've got Firefox 0.9, running on Windows XP. I've got the Single Window extension installed, the intended behavior of which is to capture all link activity and open it in a new tab, rather than in a new windoww. However, clicking on links inside Gmail messages do something odd -- a new window's opening up with the target URL, _and_ the target URL is showing up in the existing window (where Gmail's living) in a new tab. I'm probably not describing this well. But if you've experienced and fixed such behavior, drop me a line: msippey at g mail dot com.
