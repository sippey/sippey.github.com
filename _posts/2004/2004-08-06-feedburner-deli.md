More chocolate + peanut butter: [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) is [now splicing](http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/000683.html) [delicious](http://del.icio.us/) feeds, grabbing them once per day and inserting them a la [Veen](http://www.veen.com/). If you're pulling my Feedburner feed, you're now seeing [my delicious links](http://del.icio.us/msippey/) in there, along with my public [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) photos.
