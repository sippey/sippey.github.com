Why I love the web, reason #425. There's actually a blog called "[ETLGuy.com](http://www.etlguy.com/)," covering ETL projects, processes and technology. He's even got a clever tagline ("data integration, one bit at a time").

Obviously, if you don't know what ETL stands for, then this ain't for you.
