I wish I had been tracking and charting this along the way. On December 12, 2003 a Google search for the phrase "[google ipo](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22google+ipo%22)" pulled about 16,700 results. Today, the same search yields about 52,500. Note to meme watchers and keyword speculators: imagine the wave of schadenfreude that'll be unleashed if the Google IPO [doesn't perform](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22failed+google+ipo%22) spectacularly...

(Somewhat relatedly, someone should scrape and syndicate the [weekly zeitgeist results](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/weeks-apr04.html) \-\- top 10 gainers, top 10 losers. Top two declining queries for the week of 4/19? "Lindows" and "easter bunny." Wouldn't Michael Robertson look great in a [bunny suit](http://www.buycostumes.com/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=5640&PCatID=&ccatid=)?)
