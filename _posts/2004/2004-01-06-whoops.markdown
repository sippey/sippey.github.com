<p>Wow, I guess that whole mini-iPod thing must be a hit -- after all, who wouldn't want to spend just $50 less than a white iPod in order to get a 40% of the storage capacity and <em>colors</em>.  And I guess the XServe must be the thing for my server farm.  After all, that G5 is part of the third-fastest supercomputer in the world!</p>
