The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> folks are just knocking the cover off the ball lately.  Their newest invention:  the <a href="http://flickr.com/fun/zeitgeist/">daily zeitgeist</a>.  Seen here on the right (but most likely not available via RSS, so if you're reading this in your aggregator be sure to clickthrough to see the full effect), it's a badge that displays an animated tile of community photos, your photos, your contacts' photos or yours and your contacts' photos.  The one at the right are photos from my contacts.
