A quick announcement: in another week or so I'll be joining [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) as VP, Product.

I've been doing personal web publishing in various forms and methods for going on nine years now -- while doing daytime things like [managing products](http://www.advent.com/), [going to school](http://haas.berkeley.edu/), [consulting](http://www.viant.com/), [building email progams](http://www.quris.com/) and advising [a](http://www.pyra.com/) [few](http://www.feedburner.com/) [startups](http://www.flickr.com/). [Stating the Obvious](http://www.theobvious.com/) and [sippey.com](http://www.sippey.com/) have enabled me to find a voice, float ideas, build new friendships and experiment with the tools that empower individuals and teams to share and spread ideas and information.

It's not every day that you're given the opportunity to turn your after work passion into your full time job. I couldn't be more excited to join Mena, Ben, Barak, Anil, Andrew, Ezra, Paul, Mie and the rest of the crew at Six Apart.

(Yee haw!)
