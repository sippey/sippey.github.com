The issue of Reason [previously mentioned](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/04/reasonably_targ.html) in this space has hit the newsstands. Declan McCullagh pens the [cover story](http://www.reason.com/0406/fe.dm.database.shtml), "Database Nation: The upside of 'zero privacy.'" It's a remarkably balanced look at the costs and benefits of "the databasification of American society."

It's simple economics. Information sharing systems requiring opt-in consent create costs (direct costs related to management overhead and indirect costs related to more expensive product development and marketing efforts); costs which are eventually shouldered by consumers in the form of higher prices or reduced choice.
