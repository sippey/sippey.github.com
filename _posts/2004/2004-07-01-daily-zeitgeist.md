The [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) folks are just knocking the cover off the ball lately. Their newest invention: the [daily zeitgeist](http://flickr.com/fun/zeitgeist/). Seen here on the right (but most likely not available via RSS, so if you're reading this in your aggregator be sure to clickthrough to see the full effect), it's a badge that displays an animated tile of community photos, your photos, your contacts' photos or yours and your contacts' photos. The one at the right are photos from my contacts.
