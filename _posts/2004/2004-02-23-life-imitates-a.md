The New York Times stopped me in my tracks this morning; the front page photo of the skaters in Central Park (cleverly titled "Me and My Human") bears a remarkable resemblance to a print that Bay Area artist Christopher Brown made at [Crown Point Press](http://www.crownpoint.com/) in the early 90s. An image of the exact print I'm thinking of isn't available online, but a similar one from the same time period titled [_Seventy-Nine Men_](http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/brownc/79men.html) is.
