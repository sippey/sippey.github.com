Just can't tell you how excited I am about [this](https://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/11/rich_text_editi.html "TypePad gets WYSIWYG and spell check"). 

If there's anything that the current batch of web apps is teaching us, it's that the tiniest details of interaction ergonomics can have a [great deal of influence](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/04/notes_on_gmail.html "my post on gmail and its big tivo-like archive button") over how apps get used.  That's not to say that WYSIWYG post editing and integrated spell checking are by any stretch of the imagination "tiny details."  But the team has paid a tremendous amount of attention to the fit and finish of the new post editing screen, and now I can only hope that our customers will continue their tradition of piping up with feedback and suggestions so that we can make it better.
