I know this will sound like an ad, but... If you use Outlook, you need [Lookout](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/), a plugin for Outlook that indexes your mail store (whether it's local or stored on an Exchange or IMAP server), attachments, your contact list, your calendar _and even your filesystem_ and offers lightning-fast full-text search. If you're still filing email into a zillion different folders, you need to get on with your life, install Lookout, and get your head around a three-folder lifestyle: inbox, trash and "keepers."

Oh, and in case you're frustrated by the anemic "[about us](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/about.html)" page, know that Lookout is a product of Eric Hahn and the [Inventures Group](http://www.ingroup.com/). Hahn has deep, deep roots in email -- he was VP of Engineering at cc:mail, and went on to found Collabra, which became the core of Netscape's collaboration products.
