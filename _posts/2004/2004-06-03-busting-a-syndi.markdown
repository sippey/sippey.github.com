In a must-read piece, Dick Costolo of [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) [dispels the myth](http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/000576.html) that we're headed to a glorious monoculture of syndication formats and aggregating clients: "Even if we can all get along and agree on a common base syndication format and the number of different clients dwindles to a powerful few, the entire syndication space will simultaneously witness a growing sophistication and accompanied level of fragmentation through conflicting namespaces and specialty clients."

If you thought the format wars have been ugly for the core elements of Title, Link and Description, just wait until all the relevant parties start battling it out for domination for namespaces related to music, books, consumer packaged goods, calendar events, transaction confirmations, etc., etc.
