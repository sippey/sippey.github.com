Being at this conference is a little bit like stepping back in time. Eight years ago, in one of the few pieces I wrote for Suck.com, [I had a dream](http://www.suck.com/daily/1996/06/04/ "Suck: Daily")...

> A dream of mythic proportions. A dream that began with the first kill file I ever wrote. A dream of declaring myself independent of this so-called "online community." I want to become one of the Freemen of the Internet.

With all the talk of personalized search results, custom-spliced RSS feeds and APIs that will give me programmatic access to _just_ the right set of products, their prices and their reviews, the dream is just starting to come true.
