Picked up Ron Suskind's [The Price of Loyalty](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743255453/statingtheobvioua/) over the weekend. Can't put it down. Best paragraph so far, from O'Neill's account of his first meeting with Bush in the oval office...

> The President seemed to nod in affirmation. O'Neill couldn't be sure.

Frightening.
