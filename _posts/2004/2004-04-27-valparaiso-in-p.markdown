Don DeLillo's _Valparaiso_ [will be staged](http://theatreexile.org/season.php#30-valparaiso) in Philadelphia by Theatre Exile from May 5 through May 23.

> Valparaiso tracks the physical and spiritual journey of Michael Majeski who sets out on a routine business trip to Valparaiso, Indiana only to become the center of a media frenzy after he gets on a wrong plane and winds up in Valparaiso, Chile.
