Speaking of [cost per influence](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/07/cost_per_influe.html), there's an interesting piece in this month's [W](http://www.style.com/w/) (the one with [Scarlett Johansson](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/) on the cover) about the efforts of Giorgio Armani to dress the non-Hollywood A-listers in an attempt to influence the purchase behavior of their social circles.

> The designer, one of the first to get his suits on the silver screen and to set up an L.A. office for celebrity dressing, has come up with a way to reach women who don't flip through fashion magazines every month and who don't idolize Nicole Kidman or Beyonce. The strategy? H dresses a network of smart, stylish, well-bred women who are well known in their own countries and lets them get on with their lives. ...

> The ladies receive a new capsule wardrobe each season, in addition to travel expenses and, in some cases, a retainer -- depending on the individual. The big payoff for the house, of course, comes when their photos appear in _Hello!_, _Point de Vue_, _El Pais_ or _Vanity Fair_. But often there are more subtle returns: a photograph in a small local paper, or extra attention at a social event. "You can't imagine how many people walk up to me at parties and ask who designed my tuxedo jacket," says \[Celine\] Charloux, a French polo player and one of Armani's newest diplomats.

Nice work if you can get it.
