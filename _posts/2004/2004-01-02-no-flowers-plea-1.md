A 2003 resolution that paid off, at least in psychic terms: backup more frequently. In our x-platform house this is done through a shell script on the laptop that's launched from Cygwin, rsync-ssh'ing over to the iMac and dumping everything that's changed. Even over 802.11b it only takes ten minutes to do an incremental rsync once or twice a week.

Of course, this doesn't account for the servers. And I absolutely do _not_ post this in some sort of twisted, self-satisfied reaction to the fact that [interconnected](http://interconnected.org/home/) is most likely gone, gone, gone. That, friends, just makes me sad.

2004? More offline in my online. More on that to come.
