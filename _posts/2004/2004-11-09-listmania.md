Two signs that Amazon has a very diverse set of talent:  [Amazon Theater](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/13609381/104-5038919-4670339) ("a series of five original short films available exclusively at Amazon.com as a free gift to our customers") and the [Amazon Simple Queue Service](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_6/104-5038919-4670339?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=13584001&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA) ("a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for buffering messages between distributed application components").  There's a joke in there somewhere about queuing up for the theater, but I'll leave that exercise to the reader.
