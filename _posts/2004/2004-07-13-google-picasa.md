Had to see this one coming: [Google Acquires Picasa](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040713005356&newsLang=en).

> Picasa was founded in October 2001. In May 2004, Picasa announced a technology partnership with Google's Blogger service to make publishing digital photos with Blogger faster and easier. Further product integration plans have not been announced. Picasa users will not experience any interruption in service.
