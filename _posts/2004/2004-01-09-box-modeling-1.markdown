So on a whim I redid the look and feel of this site, and lo and behold, I'm apparently having an issue with IE and it's darned box model. If you're looking at this in IE6 (like I am), you'll notice that the main column is missing its one pixel border on the right-hand side. I've Google'd to death, tried about a dozen different things, to no avail. It's fine in Mozilla and Safari, but not here on IE. (I haven't looked at it in 5.x versions of IE, and I'm sure the boxes are likely busted there as well, but, frankly, don't care all that much...) Suggestions welcome.

**Update:** fixed! Thanks so much to Ethan from [sidesh0w.com](http://www.sidesh0w.com/).
