Help! How will I keep in touch with all my friends now that [orkut's down](http://www.orkut.com/construction.html)?

**Update:** Brainstorm! How about a flash mob outside of the Googleplex? Tomorrow, noon pacific. Spread the word -- this social software thing is gonna be big, and we can't let Google miss out on this tremendous opportunity!
