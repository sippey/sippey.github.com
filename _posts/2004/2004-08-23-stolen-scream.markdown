<p>So the story about the <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&e=5&u=/washpost/20040823/ts_washpost/a23334_2004aug22">stolen Scream</a> was all over the news last night, but what I had completely forgotten until reading this morning's story in the Post is that this is the second time this piece's been heisted -- last time was in 1994 at the start of the winter Olympics in Lillehammer.  You'd think they'd have figured out security by now...</p>

<p>Oh, and how long until The Onion does a piece on having an dot com office worker's <a href="http://www.sunshinejoy.com/default.asp?Item=OWINSCR54">inflatable Scream</a> punching bag swiped from a little-used conference room?</p>
