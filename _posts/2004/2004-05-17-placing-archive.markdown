[Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org) pointed out to me that the wayback's archive of placing.com [might not be so safe](/2004/05/placing.html), given what the new owners of 99secrets.com [have done](http://web.archive.org/web/*/99secrets.com/*) with their robot excluder. so unless my pal objects, placing has another home at [carlsteadman.com/placing](http://www.carlsteadman.com/placing/).
