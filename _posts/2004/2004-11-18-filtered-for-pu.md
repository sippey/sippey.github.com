Kudos to Matt Haughey for (finally!) implementing a nominal charge for [new MetaFilter memberships](http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi)....

> Due to the bursting size of the community, its use of resources, and the cost of running the servers, all new users have a one-time $5 charge, to help defray these costs. Keep in mind this is a donation towards the server, and not a purchase. If you sign up an account to pimp your product, act like an ass, or generally just do things that break the [guidelines](http://www.metafilter.com/guidelines.mefi) you will be booted and there will be no refunded donations.

I'm sure the [irony-challenged](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/1238) are happy that Haughey didn't implement all the ideas in my [MetaFilter Proposal](http://www.theobvious.com/archive/2001/10/26.html) from October 2001.
