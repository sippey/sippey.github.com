At Web 2.0... Bill Gross just introduced [Snap](http://www.snap.com/index.php "Snap"), a new search site from Idealab. I'll contribute to the blog pile on with a few quick notes...

1) Snap is a big contrarian bet against Google aesthetic. Search results are presented in a very rich, reasonably heavy set of controls that enable the use to filter and sort results. They're going to enable advertisers to create rich presentations for their products -- bucking the "text ad" trend that the goog pioneered.

2) Snap is a huge bet on increasing user sophistication. The current version of the UI is, shall we say, _advanced_. (If you like X1, you'll like Snap.) Depending on what you're searching for, the system could return results in two panes -- one where they're trying to be reasonably smart about what you're looking for, the other for more "raw" results. (Try it on a search for "[new car](http://www.snap.com/search.php?query=new%20car&family=1)," for example.) The type-ahead filtering is slick, but I don't see my Mom "getting it" initially.

3) The transparency thing is intriguing... They're making public all of their [user stats](http://www.snap.com/stats_home.php), including search volume, page views, number of advertisers, paid clicks, and _revenue_. If it works, it could provide the incentive for ad buyers to buy on Snap. If it doesn't work, it will provide a fantastic dashboard for journos and bloggers looking for a quick stat... Battelle brought up an interesting point, that Idealab company Overture pioneered transparency in cost per click, and people hated _that_ for the first year of its life...

4) Oh, and I almost forgot this one. Isn't [Snap](http://www.snap.com/) a very Web 1.0 name? [Think back...way back](http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1997/06/24.html "stating the obvious piece from 1997 about the site formerly known as gunsmoke").
