I'm an avid reader of Merlin Mann's [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/), a weblog about Getting Things Done (and getting things done) with an OS X bent.  The accompanying [Google Group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/43Folders/) is also entertaining, if only for the endless discussion of the wide variety of personal productivity tools for the Mac (Entourage or Life Balance?  Omni Outliner or VoodooPad?). 

The most refreshing gem posted to the list, though, has to be this Flickr photoset: documentation on [Getting Things Done with Index Cards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jazzmasterson/sets/48077/ "Getting Things Done with Index Cards - a photoset on Flickr").  Marvel in its 3x5-ness.  Gaze in awe at the clever use of coin envelopes.  Lust after the Brother label printer, the egg timer and the set of Copic colored markers.

And then, when you're done, task-switch back to your time-sucking RSS reader or your overloaded inbox or your miles-long list of things that have to get done Real Soon Now or the entire existence you've built for yourself will come crashing down on your head like a load of bricks, and thank the good Lord above that you're not anywhere near this organized.  You just wouldn't know what to do with the _time_...
