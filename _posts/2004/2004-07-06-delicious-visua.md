[![](https://www.flickr.com/photos/64567_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=64567 "photo sharing")This is a visualization of my delicious tagset, courtesy of [kevan.org](http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi) (via Matt Jones). Note 1: interesting things start to happen when all sorts of data's available in an XML format. Note 2: Cal Henderson has a [plugin](http://code.iamcal.com/pl/mt3/tags/) for Movable Type 3.0 to create delicious style tagging on posts, for on the fly post categorization. More like this, please.
