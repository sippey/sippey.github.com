<p>You'd think by now -- more than 10 months after CAN-SPAM went into effect -- that companies <em>doing legitimate business via email</em> would have their act together about opt-out language and workflow.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Not so much.</p>

<p>That thumbnail (click for a bigger version) is a just-captured screenshot from <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/">Jet Blue's</a> unsubscribe page.&nbsp; The language reads...</p><blockquote><p>To unsubscribe from our mailing list, please confirm the information below and click submit.<br />Email address:&nbsp; michael@the...<br />Unsubscribe:&nbsp; ( ) IN&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ( ) OUT</p></blockquote><p>Do I choose &quot;in&quot; to &quot;opt-in&quot; to their unsubscribe list?&nbsp; Or do I choose &quot;out&quot; to opt out of their subscription list?</p>

<p>Now, under a strict interpretation of <a href="http://www.spamlaws.com/federal/108s877.html">the law</a>, Jet Blue is probably in compliance.&nbsp; Their message contained a clear and conspicuous method of unsubscribing -- a link to this unsubscribe page; and the law doesn't specify any ease-of-use requirements for the web-based opt-out process.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That process, by the way, should be considered an opportunity to thank the customer for their business, not to confuse and obfuscate the unsbuscribe process.&nbsp; Companies that do it right use appropriate copy and design to (a) try to convince the customer to dial back their subscription preferences instead of unsubbing entirely, and/or (b) thank them for the privilege they've had of landing in their inbox, and apologize for disappointing them.&nbsp; Despite the millions of dollars of investment in a &quot;friendly&quot; brand image, all Jet Blue manages to do here is further annoy an already annoyed customer.</p>
