I keep [harping](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2004/01/very_rich_clien.html) on this, but Office is becoming a very interesting rich client. They have a ways to go to make services like the [Amazon Research Pane](http://www.amazon.com/gp/associates/research-pane/download_rp.html/103-7121306-5278229) easy to install and use, but they're sitting on a very interesting opportunity to put more content in context. (I'd love to see something like [Blinkx](http://www.blinkx.com/overview_us.php) migrated into the pane...) [Rememberance agent](http://www.remem.org/), here we come!
