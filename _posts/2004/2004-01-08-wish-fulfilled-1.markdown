I [ask](http://www.sippey.com/archives/000504.php), Keyspan [delivers](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040108005008&newsLang=en).

> Keyspan, (marketing assertion deleted), announces its revolutionary USB Server that connects USB devices to a Mac or PC via a wired or wireless Ethernet-based LAN. The USB Server will ship in late Q1 2004 with an MSRP of $129. Much like a USB print server, the USB Server enables attached USB devices to be used and shared by client PCs on a LAN. In addition to printers, the USB Server supports other USB devices such as hard drives, scanners, and more.

Wow, I should start asking for stuff more often.
