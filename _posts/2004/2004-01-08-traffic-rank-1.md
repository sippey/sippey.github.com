It's been a while since I've surfed any data at [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/), but the handy NetCaptor (more on that later) has built in easy access to Alexa data, so I checked it out this morning. They provide comparative graphs of site traffic -- here's eBay against Amazon:

Fascinating dip around the holidays... The data is their "traffic rank" instead of raw traffic, so it's impossible to discern from this chart the scale of the delta between the two. But if you assume there's some sort of powerlaw at work here, there should be quite a difference between the 8th ranked and 16th ranked sites by traffic...
