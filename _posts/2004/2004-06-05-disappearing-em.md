So a headline showed up in my aggregator from News.com: [Google Buys E-Mail Software Company](http://news.com.com/Google+buys+e-mail+software+company/2100-1024_3-5227110.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news), but the story 404s, and searches at News.com turn up nothing. I know I'm not imagining things, because at least one other person [blogged it](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/04#When:9:43:51PM), and Google News [indexed it](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&edition=us&ie=UTF-8&q=google+buys+e-mail+software+company&scoring=d). Who'd they buy? And what happened to the story?

**Update**, in case you're interested. Google bought Neotonic, but that was old news; the acquisition happened back in April of 2003. Which is probably why News.com pulled the story.
