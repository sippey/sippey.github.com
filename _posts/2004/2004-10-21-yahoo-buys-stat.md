Oh, man things are getting interesting in the Google v. Yahoo v. Microsoft battle.  Gotta believe that Yahoo didn't [pick up Stata Labs](http://news.com.com/Yahoo+buys+e-mail+search+company/2100-1025_3-5421831.html) for their Windows spam assassin client, but rather for the search tech that's inside Bloomba.  It's not hard to imagine them building a rich client for email and feed reading that complements the online experience that I'm sure they're building with what they picked up from Oddpost.

The other interesting thing about this is that the Outlook-alternative market is once again wide open.  It's now down to Eudora and Thunderbird, neither of which have decent email search tools, nor offer any significant "intertwinglyness" that modern communication clients so desperately need.
