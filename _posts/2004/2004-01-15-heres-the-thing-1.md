Here's the thing about this whole whiz-bang Internet. All of it -- the remarkable web applications, the fantastic presence-facilitating servers, the IP telephony devices, the XML-RPC-enabled Perl scripts -- requires actual _connectivity_. You know -- lines that sync, routers that route. I find it very disconcerting that my personal technology stack relies on SBC at its base.

Damn you, Gilder, where's my fiber?
