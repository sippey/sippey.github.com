Matt Jones [points to](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/mt/archives/000920.html) Matt Locke's thoughts on [public caches](http://www.test.org.uk/archives/000278.html), "standalone devices embedded into street furniture or trains that people could use to upload or download content." The key feature -- each device would be _standalone_. This would reduce the likelihood of one content provider spamming the network (they'd have to physically travel to each node), and create interesting effects related to "slowness."

> Interestingly, we came up with no examples where slowness itself was an asset, but a few of the effects of slowness were interesting. One was privacy/security - the Public Cache network most closely resembled the physical networks of drop-boxes and other intelligence/spy techniques. The process of uploading/downloading should be anonymous, like the messages left under park benches or empty trees in many a cold-war spy story.

This is pretty much the reverse scenario of something I envisioned about a year ago; an opportunity for Sony to leverage their wifi-enabled portable servers into a [content distribution network](http://sippey.com/archives/000252.php "sippey.com:  wifi content distribution, 12 Feb 2003") localized to high-traffic locales like airports, train stations, etc.

If I had $500 to spare, I'd plop a wifi-enabled drive on my roof, stick a high gain antenna on it and open it up as wide as possible, just to see if folks in our (reasonably high-traffic, tech savvy, Starbucks-network equipped) neighborhood would (a) notice it and/or (b) do something with it.
