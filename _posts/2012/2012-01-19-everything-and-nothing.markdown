When I visit the beach I come back with pictures of the kids and sand in my shoes. When Kevin Kelly visits the beach he comes back with blog posts like this one, [A Whole Lot of Nothing](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2012/01/a_whole_lot_of.php):

> Water is made of oxygen and hydrogen. What is a oxygen atom made of? Not oxygen, but of smaller particles, like protons and electrons. And what are they made of? Mostly space. ... I know the monks on the tops of mountains have been saying the real world is immaterial for eons, but the difference is that now we say can it precisely, and in such a scientific way that we can predict what else we should see if this view is correct. So far we can't use ordinary words to describe what this fundamental intangible is.

I'm enjoying Kevin's blog immensely lately; see also his previous post [We Are Stardust](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2012/01/we_are_stardust.php).
