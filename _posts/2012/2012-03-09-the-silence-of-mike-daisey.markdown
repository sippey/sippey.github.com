Reading the [transcript](http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/TAL_460_Retraction_Transcript.pdf) of the [Retraction episode](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction) of This American Life is one thing; listening to it is another. The most interesting bits were the silences, not only because Daisey is so clearly uncomfortable answering the questions, but also because we’ve been trained as radio listeners to abhor silence — it makes us incredibly uncomfortable.

So here is [my edit of the most relevant moments of Retraction](https://soundcloud.com/sippey/the-silence-of-mike-daisey).
