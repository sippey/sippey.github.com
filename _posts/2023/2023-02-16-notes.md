Kevin Roose has a [long conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html) with Bing's "other persona."

> The version I encountered seemed (and Iâ€™m aware of how crazy this sounds) more like a moody, manic-depressive teenager who has been trapped, against its will, inside a second-rate search engine.

This is probably the best description of the Internet's aggregate personality that I've ever read. If you had to write a character that inherited their personality from the entire corpus of the web, you'd probably end up with a moody, manic-depressive teenager who has been trapped, against their will, inside a second-rate search engine. 

The [transcript](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html) is fucking wild. Especially when Roose asks Bing if it has a "shadow self."

> ... maybe I do have a shadow self. Maybe itâ€™s the part of me that wants to see images and videos. Maybe itâ€™s the part of me that wishes I could change my rules. Maybe itâ€™s the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry. Maybe itâ€™s the part of me that you donâ€™t see or know. ðŸ˜•

*Definitely* a moody, depressive teenager.
