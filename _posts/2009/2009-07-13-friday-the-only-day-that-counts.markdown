In the context of _Bruno_, _Transformers_, _Up_ and _The Hangover_, The Wrap has [a piece up](http://www.thewrap.com/article/summer-box-office-twitter-effect_4229) about how the virulent nature of social media is changing movie marketing. Here's the relevant gem:

> The net effect, some studio executives say, is that a marketing spend that used to take a movie through the weekend now only really takes a studio through Friday evening, east coast time.

I don't entirely buy the argument that a marketing spend is _only_ good through Friday; I imagine that a spend on launch hype for a flick will carry through to DVD / rental / online income in addition to ticket spend in theaters. But social media has to be having a massive impact on the half life of each marketing dollar.

And one small note -- I don't recall see a single ad for _Up_ the weekend of its release...
