The money quote from [Erick Schonfeld's piece](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/yahoo-got-binged/) on Yahoo and Microsoft.

> This is a ten-year arrangement between two lumbering giants that is filled with execution risk. It is a very complicated deal. Yahoo’s sales team has enough trouble communicating with its own engineers. Now they have to learn how to talk to Microsoft’s.
