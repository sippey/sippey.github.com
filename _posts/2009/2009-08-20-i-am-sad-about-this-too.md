From [Sasha Frere-Jones at the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2009/08/michael-jackson-twitter.html), on the sentiment analysis of tweets re. the death of the Michael Jackson.

> It is reassuring that people are using “sad” correctly, though the paper reveals a less felicitous trend: thousands of people think that Michael is spelled “Micheal.” A study reveals that my degree of sadness surrounding this misspelling is 98.9%. (This was a double-blind study using an n of 1.)

In my own personal experience, I've discovered that many many people spell Michael "S-I-P-P-E-Y", which is weird.
