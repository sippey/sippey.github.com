I liked the Smashing Magazine post about "[the death of the boring blog post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-death-of-the-blog-post/)." While I tend to lean on the side of "good content makes for good blog posts, regardless of format," it's nice to be reminded that a well thought out design of an individual post can make for good content. (Cue oldtimer voice: it's the way the web used to look -- back when things were _hand-crafted_.)

Having said that*, if we end up with a bunch of "top ten tricks to \[insert your productivity thing here\]" posts that have really big titles, background images and custom-styled ordered list elements, those posts will _still_ be boring.

\* Yep, Curb reference.
