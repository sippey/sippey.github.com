<p>I really like the execution of the <a href="http://www.joinred.com/Splash.aspx">@joinred campaign today on Twitter</a>; good use of the product, one click simple install of the @joinred theme, and a subtle use of CSS styling to change the color of tweets coming from the @joinred account.</p>

<p>Well done.</p>
