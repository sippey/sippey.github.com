I'm fascinated by this "[satellites collide](http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/02/12/us.russia.satellite.crash/index.html?iref=mpstoryview)" story -- it's an easy way to avoid thinking about things like collapsing markets and stimulus packages. This quote from US Strategic Command is perfect: "Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky." The European Space Operations Center has some [nice visualizations](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMN2VM5NDF_mg_1.html) of the trackable objects around the planet.
