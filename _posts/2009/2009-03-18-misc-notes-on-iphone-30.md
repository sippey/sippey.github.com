Long time [readers](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/01/five-wishlist-i.html) won't be surprised to learn that I'm seriously considering installing the beta of iPhone v3 for one single feature alone -- landscape mode in Mail, Notes and SMS. Like many others, I can probably count on three fingers the number of times I've missed not having copy & paste, but every single day there are two fat thumbs that long to romp through the landscape.

Other misc notes on v3:

*   Matt Jones is [right on the money](http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/iphone-30-everyware-ready/) \-\- the hardware integration stuff is big news, and an area that's wide open for crazy innovation in all sorts of verticals.
    
*   Mmmm, push notification services. I didn't see any news mentions of developer pricing for that, so I assume they didn't discuss it. This is something to watch: ESPN delivering sports scores is one thing (there are a limited number of sporting events in a year)...messaging apps are another. The use case of real-time messaging notifications (Twitter DMs, IM alerts, etc.) is going to be an interesting one from a pricing perspective, since the volume and timing of those are, by definition, out of the application developer's control.
    
*   In-app purchases are also going to be very interesting from a pricing and user behavior perspective. In their conversation at SxSW, Chris Anderson and Guy Kawaski touched on the psychology of charging even $0.01 v. giving things away for free, and the mental transaction cost involved in making the decision to pay _more than zero_ for an item. The context for that conversation was "the web," so we'll see if the context of "the bright shiny phone" changes that at all.
    
*   I'm assuming that a developer could use the in app purchase mechanism to sell a subscription or bundle of push notification messages. App developers are going to have to get savvy about pricing and business models -- the guys at [Pinch Media](http://www.pinchmedia.com/) have to be _loving_ all the things they heard yesterday.
    
*   I'm frankly surprised by the iPod library access APIs -- I'm imagining a whole new slew of UIs for browsing and playing and interacting with your own media. Paul Lamere showed some cool music library visualization stuff from Sun's [Search Inside the Music](http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=153) project at SxSW -- I'd love to see some of that work / thinking end up on a pocket-sized multitouch display.
    

Until all that stuff surfaces, though, I'm gonna be happy with my landscaped keyboard. Because on my phone, I'm all thumbs.
