<p>The <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/07/garciafaireyap.html">AmLaw Daily reports</a> that freelance photographer Mannie Garcia -- the man behind the photo that became the Shepard Fairey / Barack Obama "HOPE" poster -- has filed a memorandum of law to intervene in the suit filed by the Associated Press.  Garcia's claiming that <em>he</em> owns the copyright on those images, since he wasn't actually an employee of the AP at the time.</p>

<p>You can read the <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/garcia-memorandum-of-law-1.pdf">entire memo in support of Mr. Garcia's motion to intervene</a>, but here's a relevant snippet / screenshot:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh, and Garcia is represented by none other than <a href="http://www.bsfllp.com/index.html">Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner</a>.  This is getting very, very interesting.</p>
