Via Donn Zaretsky’s [Art Law Blog](http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/), this news great news story that I somehow missed on New Year’s: a copper statue valued at $10,000 [was stolen from Bernard Madoff’s Palm Beach home](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/01/national/main4695071.shtml), and then returned with an attached note.

> “Bernie the Swindler, Lesson: Return stolen property to rightful owners. Signed by - The Educators.”

The story at CBSnews.com was illustrated with a photo of the statue (unremarkable, frankly) and one of Madoff…but unfortunately not of the note itself. _That’s_ what I wanted to see…along with an in-depth profile of The Educators, of course.

Also, I kind of got one of those frightened kicks out of the fact that Zearetsky linked back to me in his latest [round up post on deaccessioning](http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/meet-mr-pareto.html); I’m an observant sideliner and the fact that I’m still undecided doesn’t mean much. Nothing to see here, move right along.
