While in New York last week, I spent a couple hours working my way through [The Armory Show](http://www.thearmoryshow.com/cgi-local/content.cgi), an annual massive gathering of contemporary and modern art dealers from around the world. Here's a shot from the catwalk above the contemporary section of the fair -- it's worth viewing the [1280px wide version](http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3351151634/sizes/o/) if only to get a better sense of scale -- in this shot alone you can barely make out the _four aisles_ of booths that were in one wing of Pier 94...

I love this stuff, and love someone who _really_ loves this stuff (so I'm motivated to love this stuff even more), and I only walked away with a headache.

...and this one from I don't remember who because all I could think was "This must be how we get back to the island..."
