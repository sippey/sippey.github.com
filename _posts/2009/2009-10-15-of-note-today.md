Frank Stella [returns](http://timothybuckwalter.typepad.com/painting_drawings/2009/10/frank-stell-on-the-glass-house.html) to the Philip Johnson Glass House. The NYTPicker [tears into the Times](http://www.nytpick.com/2009/10/all-news-thats-fit-to-print-money.html) for expanding into local coverage of San Francisco ("Someday, we fear, it will be the New York Times in name only."). Bill Gates' [open letter](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/most-of-you-steal-your-software.html) to hobbyists ("Most directly, the thing you do is theft.") Merlin Mann [on the making of](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/213717128/video-wings-for-wheels-the-making-of-born-to) 'Born to Run' ("This song's a fucking swiss clock, and it still gives me shivers every time I hear it. Which is a lot."). A [vi clone written in JavaScript](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/) (my head just exploded.) Ben Fogarty's [stacked area chart](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17687233@N03/3587644769/sizes/o/) of his life ([via](http://flowingdata.com/2009/10/15/one-life-one-stacked-area-chart/)). And, finally, Ben Trott on [why he loves PSGI/Plack](http://ben.stupidfool.org/typepad/2009/10/why-im-loving-plack-and-psgi.html) (I love it when Ben blogs about the stuff he builds).
