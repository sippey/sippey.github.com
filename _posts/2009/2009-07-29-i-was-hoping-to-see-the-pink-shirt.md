Sam Altman, CEO of [Loopt](http://www.loopt.com/), was [on Charlie Rose](http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10511) last night, talking about the company, mobile stuff, location stuff, etc. Yay for Sam (!), though I was disappointed that he wasn't wearing the trademark pink polo he wore last year at WWDC...
