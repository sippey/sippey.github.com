Last Tuesday night, after Caltrans closed the Bay Bridge for repairs, I set up a single serving site: [isthebaybridgeopen.com](http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/), and then proceeded to pimp it lightly here and on Twitter.

Just because I find this kind of stuff interesting, here's a quick summary of visitor traffic and activity. The data here is from Tuesday night through "now" (or whatever Google Analytics defines as "now"):

*   2,756 visits / 3,285 pageviews
*   45 comments, or 1 comment for every 73 pageviews
*   48 tweets, or 1 tweet for every 68 pageviews
*   This was a local story, so the vast majority of the visits were from California
*   45% of visits were direct, 55% were clicks from referring sites

And the top ten referring sites were...

1.  Facebook
2.  Twitter
3.  SFist
4.  Google
5.  Planet.mozilla.org
6.  Baybridgeblog.org
7.  mobile.SFist.com
8.  oduinn.com
9.  sippey.com (hey, that's me!)
10.  bayarearidersforum.com

Obviously this wasn't a huge viral hit. But it was a fun little $15 / 15 minute project. And in case you hadn't heard, [the Bay Bridge is now open](http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/).
