<p>Chicagoist interviews <a href="http://traywick.com/">Traywick Contemporary</a>* artist <a href="http://chicagoist.com/2009/08/24/an_interview_with_ken_fandell.php">Ken Fandell</a>. The video they discuss below is one of my favorites of his.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>C: Some of your pieces remind me of the myth of Sisyphus — for example, "It's Hard, and I Could Use a Little Help" (a five-minute video in which the artist tries to assemble tiny human figurines, but ends up with a sticky mess of glue and plastic limbs). Instead of pushing a boulder that keeps rolling back down, you're trying to make these people and it doesn't work.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>KF:</strong> When I had to write art statements, Sisyphus would come up. But a key difference is that Sisyphus would get the boulder to the top, and then the rock would roll back down — and I'm interested in never getting to the top. My work is about the process of going there — in that video, for instance, it's important that the people are never made; the video mostly shows me trying to assemble them. (That piece took a long time to make.)</p>
