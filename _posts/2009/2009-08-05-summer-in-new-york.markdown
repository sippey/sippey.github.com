In addition to the usual meetings and discussions, I've discovered that there <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3790803502/">is a DeLillo fan in the Six Apart New York office</a> (which is good), and scientifically proved that the flavor of a piece of Dubble Bubble lasts <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3792452755/in/photostream/">exactly 4 minutes and 1.9 seconds</a>.  Productive trip so far.</p>
