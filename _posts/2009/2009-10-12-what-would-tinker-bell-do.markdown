<p>Steve Jobs is having an impact on Disney's retail overhaul.  From the <a href=
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/media/13disney.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NY Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Jobs provided access to proprietary information about the development and operation of Apple’s highly successful stores, and Disney executives visited Apple’s research operation in Cupertino, Calif. Mr. Jobs, who declined to comment, also insisted that Disney build a prototype store to work out kinks, a costly endeavor that most retailers skip.</p>

  <p>The company followed his advice, working for the last year on a full-scale, fully stocked store inside an unmarked warehouse in Glendale, Calif. The prototype was crucial to shaping an overall philosophy, Mr. Fielding said, noting that he discovered the shops needed more “Pixar-esque winks and nods.” To that end, one sales area is now labeled “WWTD: What Would Tinker Bell Do?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so happens that we read a version of Peter Pan before bedtime in our house tonight, and I had forgotten what an odd character Tinker Bell is.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bel">Wikipedia</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though sometimes ill-tempered and vindictive (getting the Lost Boys to shoot arrows at Wendy), at other times she is helpful and kind to Peter. The extremes in her personality are explained in-story by the fact that a fairy's size prevents her from holding more than one feeling at a time, so when she is angry she has no counterbalancing compassion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So really.  What would Tinker Bell do in a retail environment?</p>
