So tonight I’m putting the kids to bed and the youngest picked _[Harold and the Purple Crayon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064430227/statingtheobviou)_ from the shelf as the book she wanted read to her. You know the one, where Harold walks along and makes up the story with his crayon as he goes, ending as he “made his bed, got in it, and drew up the covers.” (The pun doesn’t escape the four year old.)

The iPhone was in the pocket, and I vaguely remembered an animated version of Harold. So about a minute later we were watching this.

I’m old enough to think the book’s still better (the kids preferred the animated version), but if there was any remaining doubt that we’re living in the future, let that doubt be cast aside.

This magical family moment was brought to you by the letter H and the color purple.
