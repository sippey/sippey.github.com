Sufjan Stevens, who once promised [an album for each of the 50 United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens#The_Fifty_States_Project) (and has, to date, produced two -- for Michigan and Illinois), [is now wavering](http://vishkhanna.com/2009/10/12/sufjan-stevens-interview-an-excerpt/) on the notion of the _song_, much less the album.

> I feel that the album no longer has a stronghold or has any real bearing anymore. The physical format itself is obsolete; the CD is obsolete and the LP is kinda nostalgic. So, I think the album is suffering and that’s how I’ve always created—I work with these conceptual albums in the long-form. And I’m wondering, what’s the value of my work once these forms are obsolete and everyone’s just downloading music? And I’m starting to get sick of my conceptual ideas. I’m tired of these grand, epic endeavours. and wanting to just make music for the joy of making music and having it be immediate and nothing to do with the industry itself, which, y’know is suffering right now of course. And I think it has to do with a creative crisis too. I’m wondering what am I doing? What is a song even? I’m questioning, what’s the point of a song? Is a song antiquated? Does it have any power any more? The format itself—a narrative song with accompaniment—is really beyond me now.

Which is really too bad because I was looking forward to the one about New Jersey.
