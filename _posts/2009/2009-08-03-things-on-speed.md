Worth reading in full, things magazine on [speed and futurism](http://www.thingsmagazine.net/2009/08/power-and-speed.htm).

> Our fetishism of speed is increasingly detached from the physical realm - we crave the speed of download delivery, instant communication, mobile blogging, latency-free servers, intercontinental video calling, swift screen rotation, and instant messaging. The physical manifestations of speed still exist, of course, but are being slowly stigmatised.

Relatedly, I miss [Leslie](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=leslie+harpold&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), who probably would have had a lot to say on this subject.
