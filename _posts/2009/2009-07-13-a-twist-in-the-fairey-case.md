The [AmLaw Daily reports](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/07/garciafaireyap.html) that freelance photographer Mannie Garcia -- the man behind the photo that became the Shepard Fairey / Barack Obama "HOPE" poster -- has filed a memorandum of law to intervene in the suit filed by the Associated Press. Garcia's claiming that _he_ owns the copyright on those images, since he wasn't actually an employee of the AP at the time.

You can read the [entire memo in support of Mr. Garcia's motion to intervene](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/garcia-memorandum-of-law-1.pdf), but here's a relevant snippet / screenshot:

Oh, and Garcia is represented by none other than [Boies, Schiller & Flexner](http://www.bsfllp.com/index.html). This is getting very, very interesting.
