I was wondering why [Kottke looked the way it did](http://www.kottke.org/09/01/regarding-the-new-design)**1**, all Helvetica'd up; I thought Jason would be a bit more original than that. Then I viewed source and quickly wrote up a whole post in my head about how his font-family declaration is specifying Hoefler & Frere-Jones' [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100026)**2** as the default font. Â My shocking post title was going to be something along the lines of "It'll cost you $499 to read Kottke the way God intended." But then he went and posted all about it himself, scooping me on scooping him, the bastard.

**1** For the record, I like the blue border, and the descriptive header, and the site when rendered in Whitney or Myriad.

**2** And here's the conspiracy theory / hater shiv between the ribs, just for kicks. Jason's blogged an awful lot about Hoefler & Frere-Jones over the years; do you think he paid for Whitney? Or could this be a way for Hoefler or Frere-Jones to make their way about town saying "Hey, bring up Kottke.org, wouldja? I need to check something..." and then shouting "Hey! Did you _pay_ for Whitney???"
