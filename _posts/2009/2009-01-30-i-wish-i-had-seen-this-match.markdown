From [the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/31/sports/tennis/31tennis.html):

> Only the fans were on their feet, cheering with appreciation at shortly after 1 a.m. for the longest recorded match in an Australian Open, and also one of the best. ... It was a five-set joint masterwork, created by two left-handed friends and Spanish countrymen with similar games and dissimilar records. But the top-seeded Nadal and 14th-seeded Verdasco have been in rare form here this year. They proved it repeatedly as Friday night stretched into Saturday with most of the crowd of 15,000 in Rod Laver Arena, including Rod Laver himself, remaining in their seats until the bittersweet end: a Verdasco double fault.
