Enjoying a few days in New York, where the weather can most accurately be described as "August in New York." In addition to the usual meetings and discussions, I've discovered that there [is a DeLillo fan in the Six Apart New York office](http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3790803502/) (which is good), and scientifically proved that the flavor of a piece of Dubble Bubble lasts [exactly 4 minutes and 1.9 seconds](http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3792452755/in/photostream/). Productive trip so far.
