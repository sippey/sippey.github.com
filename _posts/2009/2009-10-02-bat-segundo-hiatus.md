I hate that this seems to be a recurring pattern in the "media produced for love" category. Edward Champion puts his [Bat Segundo show on hiatus](http://www.edrants.com/bat-segundo-hiatus/) after what sounds like an incredibly lousy interview with an author.

> I’ve always maintained that if what I do isn’t fun, then I have no interest in doing it. And right now, The Bat Segundo Show, which _should_ be fun, isn’t.
