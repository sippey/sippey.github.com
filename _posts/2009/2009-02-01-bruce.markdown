<p>Bruce Springsteen, who's scheduled to give a 12 minute party this afternoon, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/arts/music/01pare.html">on the impact of November</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A lot of the core of our songs is the American idea: What is it? What does it mean? 'Promised Land,' 'Badlands,' I’ve seen people singing those songs back to me all over the world. I’d seen that country on a grass-roots level through the '80s, since I was a teenager. And I met people who were always working toward the country being that kind of place. But on a national level it always seemed very far away.</p>

  <p>"And so on election night it showed its face, for maybe, probably, one of the first times in my adult life," he said. "I sat there on the couch, and my jaw dropped, and I went, 'Oh my God, it exists.' Not just dreaming it. It exists, it’s there, and if this much of it is there, the rest of it’s there. Let’s go get that. Let’s go get it. Just that is enough to keep you going for the rest of your life. All the songs you wrote are a little truer today than they were a month or two ago."</p>
