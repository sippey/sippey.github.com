<p>Sam Altman, CEO of <a href="http://www.loopt.com/">Loopt</a>, was <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10511">on Charlie Rose</a> last night, talking about the company, mobile stuff, location stuff, etc.  Yay for Sam (!), though I was disappointed that he wasn't wearing the trademark pink polo he wore last year at WWDC...</p>
