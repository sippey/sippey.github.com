Scott Berkun on the [choice of hating v. loving](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2009/hating-vs-loving/).

> I’m not saying not to express hate. I’m still a hateful bastard now and then. It’s therapeutic, it’s fun and can be a way to bond with someone for the first time – but I’m careful not to not let myself off the hook with hate alone. If I hate something, once I’m done tearing it to shreds, I force myself to look for something with the opposite traits of the thing I hated and show it some love.
