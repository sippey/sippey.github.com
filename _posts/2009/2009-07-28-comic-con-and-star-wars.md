I'm still recovering from and processing last week's adventure in San Diego for Comic-Con. One of the things that blew me away was the massive amount of _Star Wars_ action; Brian Lowry at Variety has [a piece](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006578.html?categoryid=1682&cs=1) up today on that very topic.

> Lucasfilm's skill at stoking the embers even when there isn't much new to report -- as well as managing various spinoffs, licensing deals and brand extensions to ensure that they don't collide with each other -- represents a remarkable achievement, guided by a level of precision that other intellectual property owners would be well-advised to study.

Worth reading in full.
