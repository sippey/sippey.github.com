This is unreal. [Sample Reality](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/07/16/david-foster-wallace-don-delillo-and-the-littlest-literary-hoax/) reports on a review of David Foster Wallace's _Oblivion_ by none other than Jay Murray Siskind, a character from Don DeLillo's _White Noise_ and _Amazons_.

> Jay Murray Siskind is Don DeLillo’s only recurring character, having first appeared in DeLillo’s pseudonymous [Amazons](http://www.perival.com/delillo/amazons.html) and later as a kind of Mephistopheles character in [White Noise](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R11CAI). Now, Siskind has broken out of the realm of fiction and entered the real world.
> 
> I am referring to “An Undeniably Controversial and Perhaps Even Repulsive Talent,” a review of David Foster Wallace’s work that appeared in the prestigious journal _Modernism/Modernity_, published by The Johns Hopkins University Press. Found in the Volume 11, Number 4 issue (2004) of _[Modernism/Modernity](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modernism-modernity/v011/11.4siskind.html),_ the review focuses on Wallace’s last collection of short stories, [Oblivion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1RGE), and is attributed to a certain Jay Murray Siskind, Department of Popular Culture, Blacksmith College.
