A chat from this morning, prompted by the [apple + lala](http://www.sippey.com/2009/12/apple-lala.html) post.

So, has anyone done this? An persistent EC2-based proxy that gets US users into Spotify? (If I were really motivated I guess I could use [this post on how to create a personal proxy server on EC2](http://sprayfly.com/2009/06/28/shell-script-for-automated-amazon-ec2-personal-proxy-server/) as a guide...)
