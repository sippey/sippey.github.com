Last night we were talking about the Olympic bid, and thinking through the calculus of Obama making the trip to Copenhagen for the final presentation... I was obviously naive in thinking that this had to be a bit like Bill Clinton heading to North Korea -- for someone of his stature to get on a plane, the deal had to already be in the bag.

Obviously not. As Peter Baker [puts it so succinctly](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/sports/03obama.html?_r=1&hp) in his New York Times piece...

> Rarely has a president put his credibility on the line on the world stage in such a personal way and been slapped down so sharply in real time.

Ouch.
