I wasn't a Buffy watcher (and thus never became a Buffy fan), but I'm looking forward to watching Dollhouse this weekend. I caught most of the [Joss Whedon interview on Fresh Air](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100601869) last night, and now not only do I feel the need to connect with my inner Buffy, but also to finally watch Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog. (Yes, I know. I'm way behind.)
