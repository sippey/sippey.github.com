<blockquote>
  <p>We started on a journey approximately five months ago to try to give a new refreshed, a new energy to Tropicana.  We thought it would be very very important to bring this brand, to evolve it to a more current or modern state.  Emotionally it was very very difficult, and it still remains difficult for everyone to grasp the importance of that change because it's so dramatic.  </p>

  <p>Historically we always showed the outside of the orange.  What was fascinating was that we had never shown the product called the juice.  There was a strong drive to bring big messaging on to the carton where the biggest single billboarding was.  </p>

  <p>Having said that we wanted to take the orange and put it somewhere.  We engineered this interesting little squeeze cap here (which you guys can come up and see after) so that the notion of squeezing the orange was implied ergonomically every day when you actually went to the actual carton.  The skin of the orange is replicated on the cap, and tooled in to the cap.  The idea, of course, is to have a consistency between the purity of the juice (which is coming directly from the orange), the cap (which you squeeze every day), and, of course, the carton.</p>

  <p>The reason why that's all important is because, of course, "squeeze" also maintains a certain level of power when it comes to this notion emotionally about what "squeeze" means -- like "my squeeze" or "gimme a squeeze" or the notion of a hug, or the ideas behind the power of love and the idea of transferring that love, or converting the attitude between mom and the kids, right?</p>
