<p>James Fallows, who has a long history of writing about the "personal information management" category, <a href="http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/08/my_new_favorite_software_perso.php#">discovers The Brain</a>, a piece of software I've had an <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1998/03/09.html">on-again off-again relationship</a> with for more than a decade.</p>
