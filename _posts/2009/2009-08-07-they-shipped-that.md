I'm loving Andre's [posts about switching](http://notes.torrez.org/2009/08/android-software-day-3.html) from an iPhone to a Google phone, especially the highly opinionated bits like this one about Twidroid, the really awfully-named Twitter client for Android.

> There is a "delete" option for every tweet, not just my own, but every tweet. When you push that option you are told, "You may not delete another users (sic) status". They shipped that.
