I [love](http://www.sippey.com/2009/10/canabalt.html) [Canabalt](http://www.canabalt.com/). So the other day I [asked (lazy)Twitter for a favor](http://twitter.com/sippey/status/4819666616)...

> dear lazytwitter: pls build a canabalt stats app based on twitter search results.

...and the (not-so-lazy) Twitter listened, in the form of superstar Matt Jacobs, who [today](http://www.capndesign.com/archives/2009/10/introducing_canabalt_high_scores.php) launched **[Canabalt Scoreboard](http://capndesign.com/canabalt/)**. The site scrapes Twitter search results for the appropriate Canabalt tag line, drops those that were posted from the web (cheaters!), shows the top 25 current high scores and the average of all the scores gathered.

So I now have documented proof that I suck at Canabalt. Thanks Matt!
