Ze Frank [asked](http://twitter.com/zefrank/status/4843748732) his followers on Twitter if they had "any recommendations for a great book?" and got flooded with replies. He compiled a list ("about a third of the titles that came back") and [put it on his blog](http://www.zefrank.com/zesblog/archives/2009/10/a_short_list_of.html). They're not _all_ great, of course, but it's an interesting list and says something about Ze's fans...
