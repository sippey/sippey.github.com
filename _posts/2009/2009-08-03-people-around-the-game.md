> There are few things that feelÂ  better than crushing a 90 mph fastball or throwing a runner out at the plate from the outfield , but the majority of things I miss the most didn't happen between the lines.

My friend (and colleague at Six Apart) David Tokheim [played outfield in the Phillies organization](http://www.autograph-cards.com/s1_David_Tokheim.asp) in the early '90s, and has a great post up today about all the things / people that are outside of the game proper that he misses. Speaking of which, I could use some "Clubbies."

"Clubbies are there to make your experience comfortable with food, supplies, hook-ups and anything you could possible need. I'll never forget Pauly or Harry from Clearwater in their Philly accent saying 100 times a day, 'you good...you good?'"
