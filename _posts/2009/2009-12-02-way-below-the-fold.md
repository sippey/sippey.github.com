From [Google Quick Search Box](http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/), my new favorite preferences dialog.*

A new approach for "progressive disclosure," hiding all the "way under the hood" stuff down below the fold where users won't see it unless they scroll. (Then again, if you've installed QSB, you're probably a user who'd scroll.)

\* What, you don't have one of those?
