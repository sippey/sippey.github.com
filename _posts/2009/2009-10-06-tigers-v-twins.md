There isn't a division that I have less connection to than the AL Central, but from the highlights and stories I wish I could have seen [the game today](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=291006109). Twins shortstop Orlando Cabrera: "This is the most unbelievable game I've ever played or seen." Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge: "No matter what we did, it seems like it wasn't meant to be. This is the best game, by far, that I've ever played in no matter the outcome."

And I love this game note from ESPN:

> Seven members of the Metrodome's cleaning and maintenance crews were honored on the mound before the game for the work of those groups in converting the field back and forth from baseball to football in light of Monday's Packers-Vikings game.

Fall is good.
