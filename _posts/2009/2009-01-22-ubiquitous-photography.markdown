<p>Joanne McNeil at Tomorrow Museum writes about <a href="http://www.tomorrowmuseum.com/2009/01/21/cell-phone-cameras-forever/">the photo of the sea of cellphone cameras</a> at the Inaugural Youth Ball.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We like to remember people and events as static images, framed in our minds. And we want to remember images from precisely the vantage point where we stood at that place that night. Even knowing a million other people captured the same thing and we can search for it on Flickr, on Tweetpic, on anything really — it’s not the same if we didn’t snap it.</p>
