<p>This may be old news to all of you, but it was new news to me.  While enjoying my morning coffee, up popped this instant message.</p>

<p><img class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef011570363949970b" alt="Expedited-coho-2" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef011570363949970b-500wi" border="0" /></p>

<p>Hmm, I'd never heard of this person "ExpeditedCoho."  And the message didn't seem like your normal AIM bot, looking to start a chat about hot things.  A little Googling turned up that this was the work of <a href="http://project-upstream.awardspace.com/">Project Upstream</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Upstream is an organization dedicated to promoting social ideals through the use of exciting new technology. Our most well-known service is our swarm of robotic fish, which connects AIM users to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that when I replied "Hello, ExpeditedCoho" Upstream connected me to another AIM user in their database, and, presumably, cloaked my username as another *Coho.  Randomness ensued:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>ExpeditedCoho:</strong> I IMed you first. If I deny this later, I'm lying.<br />
<strong>msippey:</strong> Hello, ExpeditedCoho.<br />
<strong>ExpeditedCoho:</strong> who art thou?<br />
<strong>msippey:</strong> michael<br />
<strong>msippey:</strong> but i'm sure my screenname appears to be something that ends in "Coho"<br />
<strong>msippey:</strong> we've been randomly connected through project upstream<br />
<strong>ExpeditedCoho:</strong> wait which michael<br />
<strong>msippey:</strong> http://project-upstream.awardspace.com/<br />
<strong>ExpeditedCoho:</strong> i dost not understand<br />
</blockquote>

<p>There's a great <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/themissinghat/profile">LiveJournal community</a> all about Project Upstream, with a perfect FAQ.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What cool lingo do you use? I'm so confused!<br />
  A: "Salmoning/Trouting/Cohoing" is being IMed by a fishbot (see, similarly: "salmoned"/"trouted"/"cohoed"). "Hatting" is being hit by--you guessed it--a hat bot (also see: "hatted"). "Project Upstream" is the name of the group that created the fishbots. The "Hatmaster"/"Salmonmaster"/etc. we use to refer to the creator of that specific kind of bot, and an "operator" is a person operating the bot (not necessarily the creator).</p>

<p>I love the Internets.</p>
