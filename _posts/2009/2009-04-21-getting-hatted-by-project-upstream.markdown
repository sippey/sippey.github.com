This may be old news to all of you, but it was new news to me. While enjoying my morning coffee, up popped this instant message.

![Expedited Coho](/assets/2009/expedited-coho.png)

Hmm, I'd never heard of this person "ExpeditedCoho." And the message didn't seem like your normal AIM bot, looking to start a chat about hot things. A little Googling turned up that this was the work of [Project Upstream](http://project-upstream.awardspace.com/).

> Project Upstream is an organization dedicated to promoting social ideals through the use of exciting new technology. Our most well-known service is our swarm of robotic fish, which connects AIM users to each other.

Which means that when I replied "Hello, ExpeditedCoho" Upstream connected me to another AIM user in their database, and, presumably, cloaked my username as another *Coho. Randomness ensued:

> **ExpeditedCoho:** I IMed you first. If I deny this later, I'm lying.  
> **msippey:** Hello, ExpeditedCoho.  
> **ExpeditedCoho:** who art thou?  
> **msippey:** michael  
> **msippey:** but i'm sure my screenname appears to be something that ends in "Coho"  
> **msippey:** we've been randomly connected through project upstream  
> **ExpeditedCoho:** wait which michael  
> **msippey:** http://project-upstream.awardspace.com/  
> **ExpeditedCoho:** i dost not understand  

There's a great [LiveJournal community](http://community.livejournal.com/themissinghat/profile) all about Project Upstream, with a perfect FAQ.

> Q: What cool lingo do you use? I'm so confused!  
> A: "Salmoning/Trouting/Cohoing" is being IMed by a fishbot (see, similarly: "salmoned"/"trouted"/"cohoed"). "Hatting" is being hit by--you guessed it--a hat bot (also see: "hatted"). "Project Upstream" is the name of the group that created the fishbots. The "Hatmaster"/"Salmonmaster"/etc. we use to refer to the creator of that specific kind of bot, and an "operator" is a person operating the bot (not necessarily the creator).

I love the Internets.
