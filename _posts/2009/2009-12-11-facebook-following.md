Now that Facebook is pushing the defaults to public (here's [Mark Zuckerberg's wall](http://www.facebook.com/zuck#/zuck?v=wall), for instance) how long until they adopt an asymmetric follow model for individual profiles?

(Today the asymmetric follow is why fan pages exist, but if they were to dramatically simplify their offering they'd (a) collapse fan pages and profiles, (b) adopt asymmetric following, (c) put controls in place that enabled you to share content (e.g. pics of the kids) with limited sets of identified users, and (d) upsell brands (celebs, companies) on additional tools for their profile.)
