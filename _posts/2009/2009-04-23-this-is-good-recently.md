I'm a compulsive saver of links. Links I save for no particular reason other than their general greatness I tag on delicious as [thisisgood](http://delicious.com/msippey/thisisgood). Here are five recent ones. If they're not new to you, then you can derisively snicker "seen it" and move right along.

1.  [I'm leaving forumville forever. Discuss.](http://badgods.com/forumville-riddance.html)
2.  Ezra Cooper on the job of being a [production assistant on The Shining](http://lettersunknown.com/archives/001317.html). "KUBRICK: No! Keep typing!" (There, I've spoiled the punchline. You'll have to clickthrough for the setup.)
3.  A fantastic Talk thread at Serious Eats: [What do you collect](http://www.seriouseats.com/talk/2009/04/what-do-you-collect.html)? There's the usual lists of course (fiestaware, hot sauces, etc.) but also a few gems like this one: "I think I have the world's largest collection of grasshopper pins."
4.  Flowing Data on [how to fix the uncommunicative table](http://flowingdata.com/2009/04/21/visual-representation-of-tabular-information-how-to-fix-the-uncommunicative-table/). I have no idea if those circles are actually a fix, but wow, they sure are pretty.
5.  And, finally, I know, everyone's into Fuck You, Penguin. But I really loved the one about how [Egotistical deer think they are always making your day](http://fuckyoupenguin.blogspot.com/2009/04/egotistical-deer-think-they-are-always.html). "It's really because deer are huge attention whores."
