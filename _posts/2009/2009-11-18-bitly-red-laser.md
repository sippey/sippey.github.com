Hey, bit.ly -- I see an opportunity here for integration with Red Laser for a UPC shortening and aggregation service so that it's easy for people to blog/tweet about products. Price comparisons are one thing; how about scanning items to get social data, and not just Amazon product reviews, but posts / tweets from around the web, whether my friends own this thing, whether they recommend this thing, whether this thing is green / socially responsible, whether this thing tastes great or is less filling, or whatever.
