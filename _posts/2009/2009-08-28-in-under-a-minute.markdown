<p>TypePad asked me:  <strong>What are things you can do today because of technology that you couldn't do five years ago?</strong>  Here's a list of things that feel like magic, even though you may take them for granted.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a picture and have it on the web in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Have an idea share it with the world <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Think of a joke and share it with my friends in <a href="http://twitter.com/">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Send an update about where I am <em>right now</em> and have a friend show up in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3862765801/">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Learn about a band and be listening to them in <a href="http://bit.ly/lIJmw" title="amazon, whose url was so frickin' long that i just had to bitly it for good measure">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Learn about a book and start reading it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">under a minute</a></li>
<li>Have one of those frustrating "crap! what was that actor's name?" moments and then find out who it was <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile">in under a minute</a></li>
<li>Etc., etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything's amazing, you all should be happy, etc., etc.</p>
