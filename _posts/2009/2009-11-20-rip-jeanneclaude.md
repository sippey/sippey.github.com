Back in the fall of 1991 Trina and I took a long day trip from San Francisco down to the Grapevine to see [Christo's umbrellas](http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/um.shtml).

They were incredible to see in person, especially knowing a little bit about what went into the production of the piece. A finished Christo piece is like the tip of an iceberg -- you see this beautiful little bit above the water, while the terrifying process of financing, planning and constructing the work lives under the surface and gives the work its mass.

> The artists entirely financed their 26 million dollar temporary work of art through The Umbrellas, Joint Project for Japan and U.S.A. Corporation (Jeanne-Claude Christo-Javacheff, president). Previous projects by the artists have all been financed in a similar manner through the sale of the studies, preparatory drawings, collages, scale models, early works, and original lithographs. The artists do not accept any sponsorship.

Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon, Christo's wife and collaborator, died this week. (Obits from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/design/20jeanne-claude.html) and [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=a8TQBzLI943I), and a post from [Time's Richard Lacayo](http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2009/11/19/jeanne-claude-1935-2009/).) If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend [5 Films About Christo and Jeanne-Claude](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001OGUWW?ie=UTF8&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0001OGUWW), a collection of documentaries on the creation of five of their pieces including two of my favorites, "[Running Fence](http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/rf.shtml)" and "[Valley Curtain](http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/vc.shtml)."
