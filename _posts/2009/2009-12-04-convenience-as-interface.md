[Khoi Vinh on the tradeoff of convenience v. highdef / hires](http://www.subtraction.com/2009/12/04/jonny-greenwood-on-mp3s): "You could re-interpret the idea of convenience as a format’s interface — if it’s easy to use, if it provides affordances commensurate to the needs of real users in actual use cases, then it will win over higher resolution. Actually, it’s the content that really matters."
