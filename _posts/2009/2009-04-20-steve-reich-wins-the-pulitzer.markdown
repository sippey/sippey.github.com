Steve Reich [won](http://newmusicbox.com/article.nmbx?id=5958) the 2009 Pulitzer prize in Music for _Double Sextet_. This makes me insanely happy, and just heightens the anticipation for [eighth blackbird's](http://www.eighthblackbird.com/) upcoming recording. Until that arrives you can listen to an [excerpt](http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/sound_insights%5Cworks%5Ccommissions%5Cart_detail_DoubleSextet_commissions.html) at Carnegie Hall's website, or [watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IqVnvkzvNQ&feature=channel_page) eighth blackbird's first rehearsal of the piece on YouTube. Reich was interviewed for NPR's All Things Considered [this afternoon](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103295578); he was typically gracious.
