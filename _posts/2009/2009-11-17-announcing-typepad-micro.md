[Sharonda Woodfin](http://www.sharondawoodfin.net/) has a great post about what we're up to with TypePad...

> TypePad has made a lot of changes over the past year, but the one that's coming next will be the biggest of them all! SixApart is rolling out a whole new, free-of-charge level of TypePad service: TypePad Micro!

Posted here thanks to TypePad's new reblog feature. (You should try it yourself!) Huge congrats to the TypePad team...
