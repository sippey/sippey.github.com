As someone who spends an awful lot of time producing words, I find it ironic that even though technology costs have declined to the point where I can have a monitor with enough pixels to word process a document in "2 page side by side" mode at 100% resolution, I rarely, if ever, work in a word processor.

Browser textareas just don't work _quite_ the same way.
