The New York Times runs one of those [multi-author think pieces on the meaning of Woodstock](http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/from-woodstock-to-sarah-palin/ ) (here's a quick sample: "Woodstock represented one of the periodic bursts of utopianism in American culture...") and the very first commenter, Ms. Peebles, quickly lays waste to the whole thing.

> My oh my. Let’s just all pick every little thing apart about Woodstock. Let’s make it the kicking off point for all that came after it...commercializim, fair right wing politics...right on down to Charles Manson. Hey, he had long hair! It MUST have been Woodstock!

I like her spelling of commercializim.
