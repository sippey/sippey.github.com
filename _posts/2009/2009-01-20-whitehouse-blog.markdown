<p>I like this nav, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p><img alt="Whitehouse-blog" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010536dea351970b " src="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010536dea351970b-800wi" title="Whitehouse-blog" /></p>

<p>And of course now there&#39;s a canonical example of how best to integrate your blog into your website: put it on the <em>front page</em>. It&#39;s what the Commander in Chief does.</p>

<p>See also, however, Wired&#39;s piece <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/magazine/17-02/ff_obama?currentPage=all">Can Obama Really Reboot the Whitehouse</a>, which covers issues related to departmental communication policies, commenting and the first amendment, the presidential records act, etc.</p>
