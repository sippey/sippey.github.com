<p>I grew up just outside St. Louis, and even though I haven't been back in years I <em>love</em> what they've done with the Busch Stadium grass for the All Star game.</p>

<p>The combo of Busch Stadium and the Arch reminds me of the <a href="http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/photoarchive/results.asp?W=4&amp;F=0004&amp;Step=1">great series of photographs</a> that <a href="http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com">Joel Meyerowitz</a> made of St. Louis.  Here's one of them that lived in our house (as a poster reproduction) for years...</p>

<p>Here's Meyerowitz <a href="http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/photography/book_8_foreword.html">on the Arch</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every city has a celebrated monument that sets it apart; a tower or cathedral, a square or park. St. Louis has the Arch. I found it deeply moving, profound. There were days when, standing beneath the Arch, I felt I knew the power of the pyramids. It was restorative, contemplative. It was more than a technological marvel or a symbol. It was pure form, the beauty of mathematics, a drawing on the heavens, perfect pitch. It was constant and it was never the same. Light and color made their way over its surface. I have seen the Arch change from a white you could not look at to black in broad daylight. I have seen it disappear, reflect like a mirror, and turn pink, sometimes all in one day. I remember mountains doing that. Standing beside it, one sees human scale diminish as when a figure stands at the ocean's edge. It contains the space that cathedrals aspire to. You feel it most when you submit to it.</p>

<p>And the Arch View Cafeteria?  I <em>think</em> it was part of the <a href="http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=138413">Title Guaranty building</a>, which was <a href="http://genealogyinstlouis.accessgenealogy.com/landmarks.htm">razed in 1983</a>.  Here's a <a href="http://bit.ly/5Pqzo">streetview</a> of the location today.</p>
