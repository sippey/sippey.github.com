 I&#39;m a fan of <a href="http://www.destroytoday.com/index.php?p=Project&amp;id=DestroyFlickr">DestroyFlickr</a>, so when I read today on <a href="http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2009/01/destroytwitter.html">Swiss Miss</a> that Jonnie Hallman released <a href="http://www.destroytoday.com/index.php?p=Project&amp;id=DestroyTwitter">DestroyTwitter</a>, I installed straightaway.&#0160; It&#39;s still beta, so YMMV, but I&#39;m finding to be a highly polished, wonderful exercise in &quot;app by control freak.&quot; You can&#39;t customize a damned thing -- not the background color, not the font, not the app&#39;s behavior of popping an upside-down toast message.&#0160; You can&#39;t even resize it.</p>

<p>Which is why I was surprised to even see a preference screen. Unless the pref pane is just a stub for more things coming <em>(Please, no!)</em>, and thus something needed to be there, I would have rather it be an entirely preference free app.&#0160; Unless, of course, this lone checkbox is a way for Jonnie to say &quot;Hey, you know what? You thought there would be prefrences there, and there aren&#39;t. Either enjoy the app the way it is, or uninstall it. Up to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m overthinking the whole thing. </p>
