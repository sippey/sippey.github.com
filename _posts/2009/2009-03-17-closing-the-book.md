My esteemed colleague David Jacobs on [reading with the iPhone Kindle app](http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/03/blogging-is-the-new-closure.html).

> I have one major complaint: I found the act of finishing the book unsatisfying; after paging through 4393 "locations" (the Kindle doesn't entertain the conceit of page numbers) I missed the satisfaction of closing the volume one final time. The application resisted my impotent flicks, always returning to the final page.
