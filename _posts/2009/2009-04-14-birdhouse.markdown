<p>I'm spending $3.99 to support the makers of this most wonderful promotional video<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>, and you should too.</p>

<p>I don't have a <em>need</em> for an iPhone application that only publishes Twitter posts, but, <strong>like you</strong>, I am a thinker, a taste maker and a very important business person, and I have a <em>burning desire</em> to support quality online video starring the guy who shows up to frequently ask something.  So please, support quality online promotional video and buy <a href="http://www.birdhouseapp.com/">Birdhouse</a> for your iPhone today.</p>

<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/birdhouse-brings-a-wordpress-for-twitter-to-the-iphone/">Techcrunch</a>, where that frequently asking guy appears to have dropped in on the comment thread as "anon."  (Hi, anon!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone who needs to store drafts of 140 character messages for later review is an idiot. The whole point of Twitter is lightweight real-time messaging. If you are actually going to be putting thought into what you are writing, you are probably better off publishing to a real blog, instead of an echo chamber like Twitter.</p>

  <p>$3.99 for that piece of junk? I could code that in a day.</p>

<p>You should go do that, anon!  That would be <em>fantastic</em>.</p>
