<p>So on a second watch of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntyXvLnxyXk">Sports Illustrated tablet concept reel</a>, I was struck by something fundamental:  while the content looked great and a magazine interlaced with full-motion content is definitely fun to look at and page through, they completely missed on what could make a device like a tablet so great: a connection.  Specifically, a connection to <strong>other sports fans.</strong></p>

<p><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0120a714aad3970b" alt="Si-tablet" src="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0120a714aad3970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float:right;" /> To be fair, there were two small nods towards community:  the ability to share stories you read with your Facebook friends (yawn), and the ability to guess what happens in a sporting event you're watching on TV before it happens. But they struck out* on any <em>real</em> integration of social into what's otherwise a compelling media experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look at all those photos and videos of last week's sporting events.  How about aggregating fan photos/videos from Flickr or YouTube or Vimeo alongide the professionally produced content?</li>
<li>Look at those quickstats on players.  How about pulling in a live stream of tweets about that player, and a buzz index of who is being talked about (a la <a href="http://www.fantasytweetzone.com/">TweetZone</a>)?</li>
<li>How about a presence indicator of who else is reading this article <em>right now</em>, with an opportunity to connect with / chat with / connect to those sports fans?</li>
<li>Or, shoot, how about just some comments on the article pages?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know it's completely unfair to bash a promotional concept video for missing features. But as I watched this video the phrase that popped into my head was "multimedia CD-ROM," because for the most part that's what's demo'd here -- in a new format, with a new delivery mechanism.</p>

<p>The tablet form factor could be a revolutionary medium for delivering compelling media experiences. But if publishers like Sports Illustrated view this as just another channel for delivering one-way content, they're going to get knocked out* by the folks who figure out how to combine the best of both worlds -- high-quality editorial content <em>and</em> a compelling social experience.</p>
