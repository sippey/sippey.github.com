Kenneth Baker in the Chronicle re. the [collecting habits of Donald and Doris Fisher](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/28/MN6E19TL93.DTL).

> They learned as they went, he told me in conversation, seeking the advice of people they respected, but always buying only artworks that they personally saw and felt committed to. As for disagreements over what to buy, Mr. Fisher said that whenever either of them felt strongly about a work, they would acquire it and then discover whether the passage of time would bring a change of heart.

Now the timing of the gift to SFMOMA makes perfect sense. And thank God the collection is going there; I love this city, but it's not big enough (in citizens, visitors, supporters, collectors, etc.) to support another contemporary art museum. We need a stronger center of gravity...
