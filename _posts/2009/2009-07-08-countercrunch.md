Dan Lyons as Fake Steve is a [great counter](http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2009/07/lets-all-take-deep-breath-and-get-some.html) to all the blog post republishing news that Google is developing the operating system to end all operating systems.

> Point two: Who in their right mind thinks the world needs yet another desktop operating system? The hacks who are foaming at the mouth about this big threat to Microsoft are the very same halfwits who a couple years back were declaring that the desktop OS was dead, Windows Vista would be the last one ever made, Apple shouldn't bother making any more versions of OS X, blah blah. Now they're saying nope, the world does need more operating systems, especially ones like this that are designed to work extra super specially well on computers that are hooked up to the Internet. Whatever that means.

Also worth reading for points one, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. But especially five.
