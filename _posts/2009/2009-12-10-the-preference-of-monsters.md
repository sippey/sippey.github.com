Jeremy Denk (pianist, blogger) on the use of [Schubert in _Twilight: New Moon_](http://jeremydenk.net/blog/2009/12/10/schuberts-killer-abs/).

> This was one of these moments where Popular Culture decides for a capricious instant that Hundreds Of Years Of The Western Canon are temporarily useful for appropriation; it does classical music a huge favor by Noticing It. Lovers of classical music are supposed to beam and pant like a petted dog, grateful for any and all attention. Wag wag, woof woof, good boy, go play in your cute tuxedo now!

Go read the whole thing. Even if you hate _Twilight_ and have no idea who Schubert is.
