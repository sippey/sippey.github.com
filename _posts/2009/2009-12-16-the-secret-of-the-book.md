[David Jacobs](http://hello.typepad.com/) has been telling me that I absolutely have to read Bill Simmons' [The Book of Basketball](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034551176X?ie=UTF8&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=034551176X); it's 700 pages long and Simmons [post on ESPN.com](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4746227) about the bits that _didn't_ make it into the book are what's convincing me.

That, and grafs like this:

> A big theme of my book is The Secret of winning basketball, something Isiah Thomas explains to me at a topless pool in Las Vegas. (The Secret, in a nutshell: Teams only win titles when their best players forget about statistics, sublimate their own games for the greater good and put their egos on hold.)

I like this Secret, and who wouldn't want to hear stories about Isiah Thomas in Vegas? There goes my holiday break...
