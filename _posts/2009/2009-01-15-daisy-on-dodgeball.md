Daisy Barringer ~~laments~~ celebrates [the demise of Dodgeball](http://oopsiedaisy.typepad.com/oopsie_daisy/2009/01/to-be-fair-i-hated-playing-it-in-gym-class-also.html).

> I do have one amazing story that would never have happened if not for Dodgeball. I was on a date with The Boy I'm Not Dating many months ago, and he Dodgeballed our location. Minutes later, who showed up? His stalker ex-girlfriend. Fucking brilliant.
