So I've been slowly making my way through Season 2 of Battlestar Galactica (I'm a laggard), but for whatever reason didn't buy the entire season at once through iTunes, instead purchasing the episodes a la carte either from my laptop or from the AppleTV at home when I had a chance to watch another ep.

Until last night, when Season 2 **disappeared from their catalog.** I'm sure there's some crazy contractual reason why this happened, but now I'm stuck with one of two options. I can either buy the entire DVD set for the season, which means I'll have paid for the season one and a half times. Or I steal borrow the remaining episodes from a friendly neighbor in order to make my way through the season.

Live by the sword, die by the sword: I bought into the Apple digital media ecosystem, and probably shouldn't be surprised when something like this happens. At the same time, the fact that what was there yesterday, available for purchase, _isn't there today_ makes very little sense to me.
