Olivia Hudson [on Charles Darwin](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/opinion/12judson.html?_r=1): "He practiced a kind of ideal, dream-like science. He examined the minutiae of nature — shells of barnacles, pistils of flowers — but worked on grand themes. He corresponded with lofty men of learning, but also with farmers and pigeon breeders. He observed, questioned, experimented, constantly testing his ideas."
