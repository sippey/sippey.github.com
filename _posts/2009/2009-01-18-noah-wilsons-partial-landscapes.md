It was worth the trip to the [Headlands Center for the Arts](http://www.headlands.org/) today to see the _[Partial Landscapes](http://noahmwilson.com/landscapes.html)_ drawings by Noah Wilson, in the [Front and Center](http://www.headlands.org/event_detail.asp?key=20&eventkey=390) show. If you find yourself out that way -- enjoying the beach, taking in the view or saving the baby seals at the Marine Mammal Center, stop in and check them out. Here's one to tease you; they're obviously much better in person.
