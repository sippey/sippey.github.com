I've posted about [Jeremy Denk](http://jeremydenk.net/blog/) and his blog [before](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/03/on-bacon-chopin.html), but just to reiterate -- you really should be reading this. His latest -- [Elegy for Toothpaste](http://jeremydenk.net/blog/2009/01/25/elegy-for-toothpaste/) \-\- is great reading, all the way through.

> Some morning soon I fully expect to be stopped by a TSA official, who will say: "Mr. Denk, President Obama has alerted us that you are far too much of a pain in the a** to fly today." And I will abjectly consent. "Go home," they will say, "write a poem, eat a bagel, have a massage, do a crossword puzzle, fall in love, and then, only then, come back."

Go read the whole thing. It's eventually about toothpaste.
