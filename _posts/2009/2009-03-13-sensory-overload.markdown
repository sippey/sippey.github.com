<p>While in New York last week, I spent a couple hours working my way through <a href="http://www.thearmoryshow.com/cgi-local/content.cgi">The Armory Show</a>, an annual massive gathering of contemporary and modern art dealers from around the world.  Here's a shot from the catwalk above the contemporary section of the fair -- it's worth viewing the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3351151634/sizes/o/">1280px wide version</a> if only to get a better sense of scale -- in this shot alone you can barely make out the <em>four aisles</em> of booths that were in one wing of Pier 94...</p>

<p>I have tremendous respect for anyone who can spend any serious amount of time with <strong>that much art</strong> and walk away with any reasonably informed opinion of what was "good" or at least "interesting."  I love this stuff, and love someone who <em>really</em> loves this stuff (so I'm motivated to love this stuff even more), and I only walked away with a headache.</p>

<p>There were two pieces from the fair that have stuck with me, though.  First, this perfectly timed piece from Michael Elmgreen &amp; Ingar Dragse...</p>

<p>...and this one from I don't remember who because all I could think was "This must be how we get back to the island..."</p>
