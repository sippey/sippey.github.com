<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://madmenfootnotes.tumblr.com/">The Footnotes of Mad Men</a> (via <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a>) comes this wickedly disturbing set of commercials directed by Jim Henson for Wilkins Coffee.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lots of info about the spots at the <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Wilkins_Coffee">Muppet Wiki</a>[1], including this great quote from Senator John Marshall Butler (R-MD) from a 1959 press release criticizing the quality of broadcast television...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About the only clever advertising on the air today is 'Wilkins and Wontkins'. It pleases rather than irritates television audiences, and I am happy to learn that this series is bringing increased sales to the sponsor.</p>

<p>The gun to the head is a nice touch.</p>
