Had my Macbook go poof on me this morning, and since there was a spare in the office, I was up and running again before lunch.  Mail via IMAP, address book and calendar sync'd from MobileMe, etc.  The only thing that's taking real time is moving photos and music from one machine to the other; I'm not quite ready to give up on local storage for those.
