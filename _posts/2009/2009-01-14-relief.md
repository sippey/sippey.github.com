Andrew Sullivan [on his talk with Obama](http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/01/sorry-no-detail.html):

> Lots of emails from readers asking about the chat with the president-elect this morning. It was totally off the record and I’m a stickler for those rules. I can say, however, the following: it’s hard to express the relief I feel that this man will be the president soon. I realize that’s what I feel above all else: _relief_.

I’m looking forward to Tuesday.
