I know I'm late to this party, but I just have to say that as a music lover the combination of music blogs, Pandora and Lala is amazing. Project for 2010 that I'm starting one month early: monthly playlists in Lala that bookmark the songs I've been listening to / discovered via music blogs & Pandora, purchased at the end of the month.

Update: case in point, SFJ just posted his [best of 2009](http://www.sashafrerejones.com/2008/12/best_of_2009.html) list.
