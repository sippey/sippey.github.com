Hey, New York friends -- this looks like fun: [2009 Global Cut & Paste Championship](http://www.cutandpaste.com/events/global_championship/) at the Hammerstein Ballroom this Friday night October 16th.

> With the broad geographical reach of an Olympic event and the nervy psychological gamesmanship of the X Games, the championship takes the tournamentâ€™s international approach to design as spectator sport and amps it up like never before.

More "design as spectator sport," please.
