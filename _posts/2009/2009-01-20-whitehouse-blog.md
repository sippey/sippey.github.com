I like this nav, for obvious reasons.

![Whitehouse-blog](https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010536dea351970b-800wi "Whitehouse-blog")

And of course now there's a canonical example of how best to integrate your blog into your website: put it on the _front page_. It's what the Commander in Chief does.

See also, however, Wired's piece [Can Obama Really Reboot the Whitehouse](http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/magazine/17-02/ff_obama?currentPage=all), which covers issues related to departmental communication policies, commenting and the first amendment, the presidential records act, etc.
