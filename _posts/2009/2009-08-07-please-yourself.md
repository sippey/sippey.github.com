Alison Byrne Fields' post about [being pen pals with John Hughes](http://wellknowwhenwegetthere.blogspot.com/2009/08/sincerely-john-hughes.html) is amazing. I loved this bit that she quoted from one his letters to her, responding to news that her English teacher didn't appreciate her writing...

> As for your English teacher...Do you like the way you write? Please yourself. I'm rather fond of writing. I actually regard it as fun. Do it frequently and see if you can't find the fun in it that I do.

As the kids say, **\[this is good\]**.
