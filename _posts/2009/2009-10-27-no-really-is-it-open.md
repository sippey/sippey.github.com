[Is the Bay Bridge open?](http://isthebaybridgeopen.com/) is a single-serving-site I put up tonight. Please note that you should not rely on this site for _actual_ information about the state of the Bay Bridge.

Also, has anyone else noticed the irony in the fact that the first name of the Bay Bridge spokesperson is _Bart_?
