[Charles Bukowski, William Burroughs, and the Computer](http://realitystudio.org/bibliographic-bunker/charles-bukowski-william-burroughs-and-the-computer/), an in-depth look at Bukowski's relationship with personal computers, including his ode to the 16-bit Intel 8088 chip. I'm not kidding. (Via [Timothy Buckwalter](http://timothybuckwalter.typepad.com/).)
