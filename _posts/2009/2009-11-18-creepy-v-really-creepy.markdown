<p>Sure, Joe Cocker doing <em>You Can Leave Your Hat On</em> is creepy in an "Adrian Lyne softcore porn creepy" kinda way.  Randy Newman, on the other hand, doing <em>You Can Leave Your Hat On</em> (which he wrote, by the way), alone at the piano is really creepy, in a "holy shit this guy sounds like a serial killer" kinda way.</p>
