Big news [in the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/business/media/03adco.html?sudsredirect=true) today about how car companies are choosing to pronounce "2010" in ads for new models. (Shortcut: they're going for "two thousand ten" over "twenty ten".) Here's Jon Pearce, group creative director at [Team One](http://www.teamone-usa.com/), the agency for Lexus:

> "Twenty ten feels a little slick, a little self-consciously futuristic. ... There's nothing worse than trying to position -- or reposition, for that matter -- yourself with forced lingo."

Because car companies have never used [slick](http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/interior/executiveclass_seating.html), [self-consciously futuristic](http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/interior/lexus_enformtrade_with_safety_connecttrade.html) or [forced lingo](http://www.lexus.com/models/LS/features/performance/adaptive_variable_air_suspension_avs.html) before. So why start now.
