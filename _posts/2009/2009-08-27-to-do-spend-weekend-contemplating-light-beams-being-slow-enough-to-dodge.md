I really wish John Scalzi hadn't used the phrase "Epic FAIL" in the title of his [piece about technology and design in Star Wars](http://blogs.amctv.com/scifi-scanner/2009/08/bad-designs-in-star-wars.php). Because otherwise it's fun reading, in a "yeah, I know, it is sad that I'm simultaneously (a) nodding in agreement, (b) finding it funny and (c) picking which bit to blog about" kind of way.

For the record, here's the bit I picked.

> A tactical nightmare: They're incredibly loud, especially for firing what are essentially light beams. The fire ordnance is so slow it can be dodged, and it  comes out as a streak of light that reveals your position to your enemies. Let's not even go near the idea of light beams being slow enough to dodge; that's just something you have let go of, or risk insanity.

So for the weekend it's either contemplate light beams slow enough to dodge, or unpack the rules of [Eschaton](http://paytonij.wikispaces.com/Eschaton). Either way -- insanity.
