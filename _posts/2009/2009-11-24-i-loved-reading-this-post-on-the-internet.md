Om [on Foursquare](http://gigaom.com/2009/11/24/why-i-love-the-foursquare/).

> Like Twitter and Facebook, Foursquare taps into our inner exhibitionist self — a malady of the post-Internet era. It allows everyone to be a Ruth Reichl, the legendary food critic — an arbiter of taste.

(Look, I'll make the title joke explicit for you. It's a "post" on the "Internet." When we're supposedly suffering from an inner-exhibitionist, taste-arbiting, post-Internet malaise. And yes, I'm as confused as you.)
