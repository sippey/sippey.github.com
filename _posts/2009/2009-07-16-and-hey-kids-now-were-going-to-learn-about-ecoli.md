> [Food, Inc.](http://http://www.foodincmovie.com/), by director [Robert Kenner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448422/), made me feel stupid. It reminded me of every reason why I loved  [Our Daily Bread](http://www.ourdailybread.at/jart/projects/utb/website.jart?rel=en&content-id=1130864824947), of 2006. Our Daily Bread exercised subtly and restraint, with very still, bleak vignettes of the monstrous places that produce the food we eat around the world. It does this without commentary, just offering a view of what is. Food, Inc. practices neither restraint nor subtlety. Each segment of the film is broken into segments that are announced with a title. As if we couldn’t catch on that hey, now we’re going to learn about corn.
