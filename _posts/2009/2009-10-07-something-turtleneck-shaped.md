Ben Hammersley [meanders around something idea-shaped](http://benhammersley.com/2009/10/meandering-around-something-idea-shaped-but-not-quite-touching-it/) regarding cities and living in them, and "the cushioning effect of history upon reference upon metaphor upon inter-mixed system." And in the process he stumbles out a line that will stick with me for a _long time_.

> You don’t need to be Umberto Eco to riff off it for hours: it’s turtlenecks all the way down.

OK, probably not exactly the bit of the piece that he wanted to have stick, but still, so good.
