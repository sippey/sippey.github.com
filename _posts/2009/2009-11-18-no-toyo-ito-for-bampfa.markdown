<blockquote>
  <p>Museum Director Lawrence Rinder explained the decision to change course - taken by the chancellor, the museum's board president, its chairman and Rinder himself - as a consequence of the global economic downturn over the past two years.</p>

  <p>"It is ultimately the chancellor's decision," Rinder said, "but I agree with his analysis. ... We had set some interim fundraising benchmarks to have a standard by which to judge our success. ... The trigger point was in November, this month. By then we had brought in about $81 million toward our $200 million capital campaign. ... The gap was just too great, looking forward." The $200 million included anticipated cost overruns.</p>
