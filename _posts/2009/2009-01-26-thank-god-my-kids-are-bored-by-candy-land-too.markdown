<p>Steven Johnson in BoingBoing on the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/01/26/the-case-against-can.html">futility and frustration</a> of Candy Land...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not big into the “moral message” interpretation of pop culture, but plenty of critics of digital games are, so just for the record: what sort of message does Candy Land send to our kids? (And I’m not just talking about all the implicit advertisements for cane sugar products.) It says you are powerless, that your destiny is entirely determined by the luck of the draw, that the only chance you have of winning the game lies in following the rules, and accepting the cards as they come. Who wants to grow up in that kind of universe?</p>
