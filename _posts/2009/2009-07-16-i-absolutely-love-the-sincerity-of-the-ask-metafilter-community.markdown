> We still call CDs record _albums_, even though very little has been released in album form [since the days of 78s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record#Record_albums) almost sixty years ago. I'd say it'll be around for a while, since there's no better word to replace it with yet. "Recorded" is too generic; you could mean audio only, depending on the context. I'd say even worse than that, when I take my videocamera someplace, I'm _filming_ what's going on. I've been trying to think of things which _have_ successfully been replaced by modern versions of the word, but I'm coming up short.

An answer to the question [How long will it take to remove the word "videotape" from the collective vocabulary?](http://ask.metafilter.com/127492/Tape-is-a-sticky-term).
