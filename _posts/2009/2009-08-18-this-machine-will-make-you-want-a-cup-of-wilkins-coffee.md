Courtesy of [The Footnotes of Mad Men](http://madmenfootnotes.tumblr.com/) (via [kottke](http://kottke.org)) comes this wickedly disturbing set of commercials directed by Jim Henson for Wilkins Coffee.

Lots of info about the spots at the [Muppet Wiki](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Wilkins_Coffee)\[1\], including this great quote from Senator John Marshall Butler (R-MD) from a 1959 press release criticizing the quality of broadcast television...

> About the only clever advertising on the air today is 'Wilkins and Wontkins'. It pleases rather than irritates television audiences, and I am happy to learn that this series is bringing increased sales to the sponsor.

The gun to the head is a nice touch.

\[1\] Seriously, I love the web.
