Listening to the stream of the new U2 record last week, I was struck by how the most interesting bits of the album were the atmospherics -- not necessarily the usual chiming guitars or Bono's falsetto, but the electronic blips and chimes and patterns and samples that build the intros and undercurrents of tracks like <em>Moment of Surrender</em>  and <em>Unknown Caller</em>.  I kept thinking to myself "wow, that little bit right there? That would make a <em>great</em> ringtone."</p>

<p>And of course, all of those bleeps and blips will end up as ringtones, legit or not.  But it points to an interesting bundling opportunity that Apple's in a unique position to take advantage of:  <strong>albums plus apps.</strong></p>

<p>As the iTunes music store faces more and more competition from Amazon and other online sources (<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/12/26/lala-leads-bid-for-facebook-music-service-but-questions-loom/">Facebook + Lala</a>, anyone?), and the core deliverable of the music purchase becomes undifferentiated (DRM-free MP3 256kbps MP3 files), Apple's going to need to compete on a different angle.  The device integration angle isn't as strong as it once was (the Amazon MP3 downloader / iTunes integration is pretty damned seamless), and competing on price is difficult when most of what you're selling is <a href="http://www.blog.ni9e.com/archives/2009/02/available_onlin_1.html">available online for free</a>.</p>

<p>Today, Apple's offering digital add ons to album sales through iTunes -- typically these are things like PDF booklets, add-on videos, behind the scenes footage, etc..  But what I keep waiting for are the <strong>iPhone specific bundles that provide a platform specific experience</strong> for the fan that's tied into the Apple product line.  There's no need to sell <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/2003/07/28.html">pre-loaded hardware</a> with the artist's catalog...instead, develop applications that turn any iPhone / iPod Touch into a platform for fandom, and deliver those either bundled with tracks or a la carte...</p>

<p>Miscellaneous product ideas, in no particular order...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An app that installs a custom sounds set of ringtones / alert sounds that are based on the sounds from the record.</p></li>
<li><p>An app that provides a front-of-the-line concert ticket purchasing opportunities (think what American Express does, but exclusively for iPhone users), and real time tour info -- dates and locations, of course, but also set lists, photos, notes from the artist, comments from fans, etc...</p></li>
<li><p>An app that provides enhanced access to the band's social web presence.  Simple registration, userpic badging, exclusive video content, etc.  Couple this with geolocation services and the (yet to be released) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fMDdmcsaU">push notification service</a> and music marketers can reach specific fans in specific locations at specific times for reaching specific fans in specific locations and encourage, well, specific behaviors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Steve Rubel recently pointed out on this blog three ways that <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2009/02/media-innovation.html">media is innovating with user interfaces</a> -- mobile being one of them.  The music industry has a similar opportunity (and, frankly, motivation) for innovation around how to fans can engage with the artists they love.  Browsing through the App Store today, there are very, very few artist-specific music applications available.  But I can't imagine it will take long for the labels and Apple to capitalize on the hardware + software + distribution channel combination of the iPhone + iTunes.</p>
