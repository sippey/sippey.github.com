<p>Back in the fall of 1991 Trina and I took a long day trip from San Francisco down to the Grapevine to see <a href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/um.shtml">Christo's umbrellas</a>.  </p>

<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/um.shtml"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef012875be116c970c" alt="Christo-Umbrellas_US" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef012875be116c970c-500wi"  /></a></p>

<p>They were incredible to see in person, especially knowing a little bit about what went into the production of the piece.  A finished Christo piece is like the tip of an iceberg -- you see this beautiful little bit above the water, while the terrifying process of financing, planning and constructing the work lives under the surface and gives the work its mass.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The artists entirely financed their 26 million dollar temporary work of art through The Umbrellas, Joint Project for Japan and U.S.A. Corporation (Jeanne-Claude Christo-Javacheff, president). Previous projects by the artists have all been financed in a similar manner through the sale of the studies, preparatory drawings, collages, scale models, early works, and original lithographs. The artists do not accept any sponsorship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon, Christo's wife and collaborator, died this week.  (Obits from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/arts/design/20jeanne-claude.html">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=a8TQBzLI943I">Bloomberg</a>, and a post from <a href="http://lookingaround.blogs.time.com/2009/11/19/jeanne-claude-1935-2009/">Time's Richard Lacayo</a>.)
