I'm spending $3.99 to support the makers of this most wonderful promotional video**1**, and you should too.

{% include youtube.html id="S8yRaWY1xV8" %}

I don't have a _need_ for an iPhone application that only publishes Twitter posts, but, **like you**, I am a thinker, a taste maker and a very important business person, and I have a _burning desire_ to support quality online video starring the guy who shows up to frequently ask something. So please, support quality online promotional video and buy [Birdhouse](http://www.birdhouseapp.com/) for your iPhone today.

**1** Via [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/04/14/birdhouse-brings-a-wordpress-for-twitter-to-the-iphone/), where that frequently asking guy appears to have dropped in on the comment thread as "anon." (Hi, anon!)

> Anyone who needs to store drafts of 140 character messages for later review is an idiot. The whole point of Twitter is lightweight real-time messaging. If you are actually going to be putting thought into what you are writing, you are probably better off publishing to a real blog, instead of an echo chamber like Twitter.

You should go do that, anon! That would be _fantastic_.
