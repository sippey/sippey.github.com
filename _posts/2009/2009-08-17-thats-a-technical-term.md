From [Cult of Mac](http://www.cultofmac.com/interview-apples-gigantic-new-data-center-hints-at-cloud-computing/14680) comes this nugget about Apple's cloud computing plans.

> "Apple is planning about 500,000 square feet of data center space in a single building," says Rich Miller, editor of Data Center Knowledge. "That would place it among the largest data centers in the world... **This would qualify as a big-ass data center**."

Emphasis mine.
