Congrats to Facebook on [joining the OpenID foundation](http://openid.net/2009/02/05/facebook-joins-openid-foundation-board/). It's a smart move on their part and I'm looking forward to seeing how they implement it across their platform. And huge kudos to David Recordon and Chris Messina for driving this home.
