I have a Cayce Pollard-sized crush on Lisbeth Salander, one of the main characters in Stieg Larsson's _[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo)_, yet I had no idea the book has already been made into a (Swedish) [film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/). Fred Wilson has all the [instructions](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/10/open-subtitles.html) on how he and his wife downloaded the movie and nabbed English subtitles from [Open Subtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org/). Project for next weekend...after I finish the book.
