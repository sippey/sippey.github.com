Ev's post [outlining the rationale for the implementation of RTs](http://evhead.com/2009/11/why-retweet-works-way-it-does.html) in Twitter is full of interesting bits*, but this is the sentence that stuck out in the post. Emphasis his:

> This last point \[re. unstructured data\] is not obvious but is particularly important for fulfilling Twitter's goal of helping you _discover the information that matters most to you as quickly as possible._

I think this is the first time I've seen Twitter's goal stated that succinctly. I Googled the phrase and scanned the Twitter website and couldn't find an occurrence of it before...did I miss it somewhere obvious? I like it -- it's deep, wide and actionable. And without being heavy-handed about it, it necessarily makes the acts of _contributing_ to Twitter (tweeting, RTing, favoriting, following, listing) crucial inputs into the act of _discovering_ on Twitter. (Think: social filtering, preference mining, influence analysis, etc.)

Ev goes on to define the perfect Twitter; emphasis mine this time:

> The perfect Twitter would show you only the stuff you care about -- relevant, timely, local, funny, whatever you're most interested in -- _even if you don't follow the person who wrote it._ And, of course, it would give you ultimate, fine-grained control in how to do so. We want to give you more ways to help the good stuff bubble to the top.

Which is the perfect bookend to [David Hornik's post](http://ventureblog.com/articles/2009/11/monetizing_twitter_--_bring_on_the_ads.php) this morning about Twitter and advertising.

\* I have lots of opinions about commentless RTs, but am holding back until I've had a chance to experience them firsthand.
