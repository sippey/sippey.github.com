Anil has two really great and non-obvious points for developers in his post [The Twitter API is Finished](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/12/the-twitter-api-is-finished.html). First, support RSD (yes!). Second, overload the source element.

> The source element of status updates in the Twitter API is very interestingly open-ended, and supports use of URLs. Instead of merely advertising your client app, smart use of rel attributes and URLs here could help bootstrap some very interesting new potential.
