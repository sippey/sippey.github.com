"Ok hi, heh, ok heh. My name is b0xxy. Most of you know me as um oom ugh um most of you know me as b0xxy. I suppose if you're watching this you probably know me as b0xxy, but um ugh ugh most of you don't know me as moldy lunchbox..."

Andy Baio transcribes [this b0xxy video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoP6HkxjS38) in the comment thread of [this post by Rex Sorgatz](http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-5628.cfm). At least, it looks like Andy did it; maybe he outsourced it to [Mechanical Turk](http://waxy.org/2008/09/audio_transcription_with_mechanical_turk/)? ([More b0xxy context](http://boxxystory.blogspot.com/), which I'm sure is _exactly_ what you're looking for on inauguration eve.)

**Update:** Andy points out in the comments that he pulled the transcription from [Encyclopedia Dramatica](http://encyclopediadramatica.com/B0xxy). Which, you know, is sorta like Mechanical Turk.
