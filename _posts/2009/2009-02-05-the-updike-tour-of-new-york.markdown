Via [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/09/02/updikes-urban-bushwhack) comes [In Updike's Footsteps](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2009/02/remembering-upd-6.html), a post from a couple of New Yorker bloggers who retraced the path that Updike took in his [1956 Talk of the Town piece](http://www.kottke.org/09/02/updikes-urban-bushwhack) where he described a way to get from the Empire State Building to Rockefeller Center without using 5th or 6th avenues.

Since I'm sure you've all already seen that post, here's the value add: how great would it be if some enterprising young New Yorker took it upon him- or herself to start a walking tour of New York that took that path: the John Updike tour of New York. And may I suggest the perfectly complementary marketing vehicle -- those little ads in the back of the magazine.
