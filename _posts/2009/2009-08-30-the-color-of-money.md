If [this is what happens](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/175499806/deposition) when you finally get through your email, then I'm all for more of this Inbox Zero stuff from Merlin.

If you haven't read it, I won't spoil it for you. But I can't help thinking of it as a response to Eggers' [Max at Sea](http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2009/08/24/090824fi_fiction_eggers). (And, frankly, a much better response than Choire Sicha and Tom Scocca's [chat transcript riff](http://www.theawl.com/2009/08/the-shadow-editors-hands-off-that-rumpus-dave-eggers) at The Awl, as much as I loved Choire's line "Wow, who's Renata Adler now?" line, since it's so far inside baseball as to be made of pure cushioned cork center.)
