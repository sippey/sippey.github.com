The American Prospect has a great [appreciation of Jeanne-Claude](http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=recognizing_jeanne_claude).

> If Jeanne-Claude's portion of their work was in large part managing and bringing about the wrapping of the Pont Neuf in gold fabric despite then-Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac's grave hesitations, so much the better -- the process _is_ the work. Jeanne-Claude's battle for recognition has helped shed light on the art world's discomfort with recognizing both women and the process behind creating large-scale work. That process was part of her work, too.
