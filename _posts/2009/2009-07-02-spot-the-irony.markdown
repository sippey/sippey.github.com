From [Techcrunch's story](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/02/one-more-thing-the-new-facebook-iphone-app-will-allow-for-video-uploads-too/) about the new Facebook iPhone app. Can you spot the irony?

> Hewitt just started working on the feature yesterday, thinking it would be something that would come in the next release, after this one. But he was surprised at how quickly he was able to get it up and running and so he tweeted out today, "3GS video uploading for the Facebook iPhone app is a go — didn’t plan to include it in the 3.0 update, but it was really easy to code."
