How many pitches have you heard where the product was destined to be “TiVo for the Web?” _(Hint: [Google says](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tivo%20for%20the%20web%22) about 7,300. Your number may vary.)_ Now TiVo doesn’t want to be TiVo for television, but instead the [Google of TV](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/tivo-redesigns.html).

So now, if you want to pitch your idea as TiVo for the web, be prepared to turn your product into Google for the web, which, you know, already exists.
