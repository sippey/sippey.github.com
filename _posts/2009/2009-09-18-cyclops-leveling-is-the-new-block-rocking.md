Bob Lefsetz does a [rundown](http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/09/18/sales-week-ending-91309/) of the top selling records. Coming in at number 48, Darius Rucker's "Learn to Live."

> A Hootie record.  Serviceable songs delivered in a heartfelt manner.  This still works in country, but not in pop.  In pop you’ve got to dress up like an alien, use computers and have beats that would level a cyclops.  But it’s the country artists who have careers, who people want to see on the road.  And if you still think country is twang, you haven’t listened in eons.
