[Mag+ on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/8217311).

There's a ton to dive in to here, but the core difference I'll point out between this concept and [the Sports Illustrated](http://www.sippey.com/2009/12/what-was-missing-from-the-sports-illustrated-tablet-concept.html) one is Bonnier & BERG chose to focus on the _user_ instead of the _content_. This wasn't about the exclusive photos and real-time sports scores...this was about how a tablet could deliver a great experience for the user.

As for the social pieces: even though this demo was similarly light on demonstrating what the opportunities are for a rich, connected reader like this, I'd trust that this user-centered approach would lead to the right mix of ingredients.
