Great op-ed from Paul Kedrosky and Brad Feld in today's WSJ [proposing a startup visa](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574525772299940870.html). The challenge with getting something like this passed is having congresscritters understand this key point: "Would it work every time? Of course not. It would fail more often than not. Start-ups often fail."
