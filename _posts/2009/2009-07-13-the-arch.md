I grew up just outside St. Louis, and even though I haven't been back in years I _love_ what they've done with the Busch Stadium grass for the All Star game.

The combo of Busch Stadium and the Arch reminds me of the [great series of photographs](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/photoarchive/results.asp?W=4&F=0004&Step=1) that [Joel Meyerowitz](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com) made of St. Louis. Here's one of them that lived in our house (as a poster reproduction) for years...

Here's Meyerowitz [on the Arch](http://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/photography/book_8_foreword.html)...

> Every city has a celebrated monument that sets it apart; a tower or cathedral, a square or park. St. Louis has the Arch. I found it deeply moving, profound. There were days when, standing beneath the Arch, I felt I knew the power of the pyramids. It was restorative, contemplative. It was more than a technological marvel or a symbol. It was pure form, the beauty of mathematics, a drawing on the heavens, perfect pitch. It was constant and it was never the same. Light and color made their way over its surface. I have seen the Arch change from a white you could not look at to black in broad daylight. I have seen it disappear, reflect like a mirror, and turn pink, sometimes all in one day. I remember mountains doing that. Standing beside it, one sees human scale diminish as when a figure stands at the ocean's edge. It contains the space that cathedrals aspire to. You feel it most when you submit to it.

And the Arch View Cafeteria? I _think_ it was part of the [Title Guaranty building](http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&id=138413), which was [razed in 1983](http://genealogyinstlouis.accessgenealogy.com/landmarks.htm). Here's a [streetview](http://bit.ly/5Pqzo) of the location today.
