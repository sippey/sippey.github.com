Claudine Ise has a [great post](http://badatsports.com/2009/ho-ho-ho-holiday-train/) up at Bad at Sports about happening upon the Chicago Transit Authority's fabled Holiday Train.

> Everyone is grinning, laughing, excited that they’ve found the CTA equivalent of the golden ticket. Me most of all. The interior of the train glows red and green–a bit sickly, but still nice. There are tinsel and red bows everywhere. Even the rail poles are wrapped in candy cane striping. I cannot stop beaming – I know I look like an idiot but I don’t care. It’s the holiday train!

The photos are fantastic.
