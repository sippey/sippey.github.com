Via [subtraction.com](http://www.subtraction.com/2009/08/12/random-acts-of-design-kindness) comes this great post from Jeff Howard at Design for Service about [the endless arms race](http://designforservice.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/the-problem-with-service-design/) of quality v. customer expectations...

> I pretty much expect FedEx never to lose my package. In fact, I expect overnight delivery to anywhere in the world. How crazy is that? Itâ€™s taken fewer than 30 years for something magical to become a commonplace.

> At what point do we hit the wall with services? Are they ever actually good enough, or is it an endless arms race against mediocrity and commoditization?

Howard's proposed solution -- unpredictability and "random acts of kindness" -- makes sense to me, esp. when looking at service design through the lens of brains-as-pattern-recognition machines. If the brain doesn't recognize the pattern, it pays attention. _(Jeff Hawkins' book [On Intelligence](http://www.onintelligence.org/) should be required reading for product and service designers, IMHO.)_ The challenge is finding just the right pattern breaker that pleasantly surprises and is cost- and operationally-effective to deliver.
