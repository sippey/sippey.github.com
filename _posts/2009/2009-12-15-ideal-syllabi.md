In [the spirit of](http://www.frieze.com/publications/details/an_ideal_syllabus/) Jerry Saltz, Tyler Green asks his artists to pick their favorite / most-valued; [first in the series](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2009/12/artists_pick_books_anne_appleb.html) is one of my favorite painters, [Anne Appleby](http://www.applebystudios.com/Site/welcome.html). She picks books by W.S. Merwin, Jim Harrison, Louise Erdrich, John O'Donohue and Susan Sontag. Look forward to the rest of the artists in Green's series...
