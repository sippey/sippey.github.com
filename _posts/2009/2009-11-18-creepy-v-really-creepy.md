Sure, Joe Cocker doing _You Can Leave Your Hat On_ is creepy in an "Adrian Lyne softcore porn creepy" kinda way. Randy Newman, on the other hand, doing _You Can Leave Your Hat On_ (which he wrote, by the way), alone at the piano is really creepy, in a "holy shit this guy sounds like a serial killer" kinda way.
