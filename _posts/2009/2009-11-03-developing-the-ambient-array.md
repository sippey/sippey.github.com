Do you love cities? And architecture? And computers? And vague phrases like "ambient arrays" and "biophysical mesh networks" and "knowable material"? Do you dress primarily in black? Then chances are you could probably use Molly Steenson's new [Urban Informatics Speech Title Generator](http://activesocialplastic.com/urbancomputing/) to help you brainstorm your next talk at that great conference where other lovers of biophysical mesh networks will gather.

Favorites of mine:

*   Discussing the Playful Map
*   Activating the Physical Thing
*   Developing the Ambient Array
