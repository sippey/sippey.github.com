I have no idea what _Clash of the Titans_ is even about, but thanks to [rhbaby's description of the just-pulled but just-before-that-leaked second trailer](http://oofblamargh.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/second-awesome-clash-of-the-titans-trailer-leaks-out-early-firstshowingnet.html) for the movie, now I have to see it.

> The trailer got pulled, so below is an artist representation. First Zeus was all "Mortals suck!" and he would have thrown down some of the lightning - WHOOSHCRASH! - except he didn't. Then we saw a glimpse of Pegasus and that rocked, and there was some dude with a sword and he was all "Mortals don't suck!" and he ran some places, jumped around and then was all "WTF!? GIANT GODDAMN FUCKING SCORPIONS!!1!"

I won't ruin the artist representation; [click through](http://oofblamargh.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/second-awesome-clash-of-the-titans-trailer-leaks-out-early-firstshowingnet.html) for yourself.
