A quick followup on February's post re. the [Tropicana repackaging debacle](http://www.sippey.com/2009/02/peter-arnell-on-tropicana.html). A few weeks ago my eight year old daughter and I were in the local grocery store and when she passed the o.j. section there were some cartons of Tropicana with the new packaging -- the ones that I thought had been recalled...the ones with the screwtop that looks and feels like an orange.

"Oh my God, Dad!" she shouted. "Check this out! The top! Of this orange juice! It's like an orange! That's so cool!"

I just wanted to squeeze her tight.
