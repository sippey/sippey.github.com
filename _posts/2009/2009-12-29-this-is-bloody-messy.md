When the Facebook data team [released](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?id=8394258414&ref=mf&note_id=205925658858) a bunch of data about diversity on their network, my first thought was "Oh, man -- can't wait to read Danah Boyd's blog on this..." [Here she is](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/12/29/race_and_social.html), with a terrific understatement ("Of course, this is bloody messy.") and a crucial point on the different levels of _access_ to social media.

In other words, if you're friends with 24/7 always-on geeks, what you're experiencing with social media is very different than if you're experiencing social media in a community where your friends all spend 12+ hours a day doing a form of labor that doesn't allow access to internet technologies.
