One quick note on theÂ [DroidDoes](http://www.droiddoes.com/) campaign: the whole site is built in Flash, which makes it completely unreadable on the iPhone. This fact may be some cute inside baseball play on the "iDon't" theme, but as a marketing tactic it's absolutely boneheaded. Dear Verizon: your campaign is a _meme_. You want it to _spread_. To people with _iPhones_.
