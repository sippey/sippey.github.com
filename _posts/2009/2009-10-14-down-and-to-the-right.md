The New York Times covers "[dark pools](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/business/15exchange.html?ref=business)" and other electronic exchange rivals to the NYSE, and shares this tidbit:

> Today, 36 percent of daily trades in stocks that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange are actually executed on the exchange, down from about 75 percent nearly four years ago.

That's a massive change in behavior in four years.
