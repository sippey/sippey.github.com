Mena pointed me to [Style Rookie](http://tavi-thenewgirlintown.blogspot.com/) ("Tiny 13 year old dork that sits inside all day wearing awkward jackets and pretty hats") and now I Can't Stop Reading. I'll do this this one time to get it out of my system and avoid reblogging every new thing she posts; here's the intro to [her latest](http://tavi-thenewgirlintown.blogspot.com/2009/11/meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.html)*...

> Hi! How are you? How was your weekend? What did you do? What'd you think of TaySwift on SNL? What'd you think of some sports event that took place these past couple days? How's your cat? How's your dog? How's your husband? The newborn? OH UH HUH GOOD STORY GUESS WHAT
