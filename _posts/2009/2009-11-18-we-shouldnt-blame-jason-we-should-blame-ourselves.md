Jason Kottke, on his [weblog](http://kottke.org/09/11/cormac-mccarthy-interview).

> Before reading this interview, I didn't know much about \[Cormac\] McCarthy -- he's a fellow at [the Santa Fe Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute#Resident_faculty)? \-\- but now I think I need to read The Road.

If this truly is the first time that Jason mothereffin Kottke has been interested in Cormac McCarthy than **WE HAVE FAILED AS A NATION**.
