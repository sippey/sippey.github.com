TypePad asked me: **What are things you can do today because of technology that you couldn't do five years ago?** Here's a list of things that feel like magic, even though you may take them for granted.

*   Take a picture and have it on the web in [under a minute](http://www.flickr.com/)
*   Have an idea share it with the world [under a minute](http://www.typepad.com/)
*   Think of a joke and share it with my friends in [under a minute](http://twitter.com/)
*   Send an update about where I am _right now_ and have a friend show up in [under a minute](http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/3862765801/)
*   Learn about a band and be listening to them in [under a minute](http://bit.ly/lIJmw "amazon, whose url was so frickin' long that i just had to bitly it for good measure")
*   Learn about a book and start reading it in [under a minute](http://www.amazon.com/kindle)
*   Have one of those frustrating "crap! what was that actor's name?" moments and then find out who it was [in under a minute](http://www.google.com/mobile)
*   Etc., etc.

Everything's amazing, you all should be happy, etc., etc.
