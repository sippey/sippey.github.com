Natasha Vargas-Cooper got [a book deal](http://madmenfootnotes.com/post/188023981/always-be-smoking-mad-men-footnotes-the-book) out of her most excellent blog [Footnotes of Mad Men](http://madmenfootnotes.com/) (congrats!), and, predictably, the comment thread at [The Awl](http://www.theawl.com/2009/09/natasha-vargas-cooper-sells-mad-men-book) is full of great action, including this bit from Choire:

> I think most hating on book deals -- though there’s still plenty of valid book-deal-hating to do, believe me, and I intend to do some of it someday soon -- has to do with the idea of scarcity. There isn’t such a thing, really. Right now, in this world? Absolutely anyone can sell a book, if they want to put up with the pain in the ass of producing said book, which, ugh, is a pain in the ass.

That lack of scarcity line -- especially in the context of book production -- is gonna stick with me for a while.
