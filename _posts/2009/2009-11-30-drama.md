Back in the mid-90s, Jerry Kaplan wrote a great book about the adventures of GO Corporation, titled [Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140257314?ie=UTF8&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0140257314).

I'd preorder the book(s) [about the Crunchpad](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/30/crunchpad-end/) today if I could.
