James Fallows, who has a long history of writing about the "personal information management" category, [discovers The Brain](http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/08/my_new_favorite_software_perso.php#), a piece of software I've had an [on-again off-again relationship](http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1998/03/09.html) with for more than a decade.

> The program has the rare combination of virtues I have previously appreciated in Zoot, Agenda, et al. It is very flexible: there are few hard-wired constraints, and if you decide at any time that you want to change how info is structure or organized, that's easy to do.

What threw me for a loop, though, was that a screenshot in the piece of [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/)'s brain includes a reference to a former colleague of mine, [Jack Griffin](http://twitter.com/jjg72), who's living in Switzerland.
