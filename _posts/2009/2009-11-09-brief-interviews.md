The Office's John Krasinski has written and directed [a film adaptation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790627/#) of David Foster Wallace's [Brief Interviews With Hideous Men](http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Interviews-Hideous-Men-Stories/dp/0316925411). I had no idea.

Two quick notes:

*   Actually, I had no idea until learned about it [via the always helpful Ezra Cooper](http://lettersunknown.com/archives/001412.html), who writes that it "can maybe best be described as a scarifying experience. Not redeptive, or cathartic, certainly, but more of a bracing shove."
*   If you [Google the title](http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=brief+interviews+with+hideous+men&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), the IMDB.com page for the film now outranks the Amazon.com page for the book. Hooray for Hollywood! (And for AMZN, obviously.)
