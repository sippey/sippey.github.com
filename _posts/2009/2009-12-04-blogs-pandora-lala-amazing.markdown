<p>I know I'm late to this party, but I just have to say that as a music lover the combination of music blogs, Pandora and Lala is amazing. Project for 2010 that I'm starting one month early:  monthly playlists in Lala that bookmark the songs I've been listening to / discovered via music blogs &amp; Pandora, purchased at the end of the month.</p>

<p><small>Update:  case in point, SFJ just posted his <a href="http://www.sashafrerejones.com/2008/12/best_of_2009.html">best of 2009</a> list.</small></p>
