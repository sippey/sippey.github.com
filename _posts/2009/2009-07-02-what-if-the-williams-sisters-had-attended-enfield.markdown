From Peter Bodo's [Tennis World blog](http://tennisworld.typepad.com/tennisworld/2009/06/q-15-years-ago-your-career-started-in-oakland-that-night-when-you-played-did-you-have-any-idea-where-your-career-was-going.html "TENNIS.com - Peter Bodo's TennisWorld - Williams Family Woodshed").

> One of the themes emerging from this edition of the Championships is that the Williamses may have gotten better with age, even as they've had to struggle with (or simply endure) waning motivation as the siren song of "normal" life has lured them toward the shoals of inconsistency. The girls may not be as reliably destructive as they once were, but when they paint on their game faces, they may be playing the best tennis either of them has ever conjured up. This may not be true at all tournaments, either, but if you're going to pick one event at which to go medieval on your rivals, this one would be it.

I'm in the middle of re-reading Infinite Jest, and so I can't help but be obsessed with tennis lately, and look at everything through the lens of Enfield Tennis Academy. The Williams sisters :: The Incandenza brothers as Richard Williams :: Himself? (Yeah, on second thought, maybe not.)
