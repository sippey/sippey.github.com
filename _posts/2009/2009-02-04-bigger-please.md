A brief note to the architect who designs the next airport in Las Vegas: make it bigger. The current McCarran airpot is way too small. Not in terms of number of gates -- I'm not qualified to opine on whether this airport will need more gates. It needs to be just simply, physically _bigger_ so that it's in scale with the rest of Las Vegas. You can't have a mall or a conference facility or a hotel that's 10x normal scale -- redwood-height ceilings, boulevard-width hallways, cavernous conference rooms, restaurants that seat thousands -- and have an airport that's merely "normal." It's too jarring, the experience is way out of scale. So at a minimum, the next version of McCarran needs to be at **least** as big as the United terminal at O'Hare. Preferably bigger. Much bigger.
