So yeah, I think I'll hang back on that [Snow Leopard thing for a bit](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/177715198/confessional). I've bought it, of course, but I'll wait until all my super early adopter friends with their five machines and their Macports and their virtualenvs and their tricked out Quicksilver installs get things working right. Then I'll pull the trigger.

Until then, you can call me laggard boy.
