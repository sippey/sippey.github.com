This has to be the ultimate\[1\] definition of “first world problem:” Matt (as in “where the hell is”) Harding had to book two zero-gravity plane flights to film a snippet for his [ongoing project](http://www.wherethehellismatt.typepad.com/blog/) because on the first one [his hard drive-based camcorder failed](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-perils-of-zero-gravity-videography/).

> Like all modern hard drives, the Sony SR1’s hard drive has a drop-detection system. When it thinks it’s falling, the hard drive heads park themselves to prevent damage upon impact. Unfortunately, in zero gravity, the camcorder always thinks it’s falling.

\[1\] “Ultimate” in both senses of the word, because from here on out all problems identified as first world problems will be judged against this one.
