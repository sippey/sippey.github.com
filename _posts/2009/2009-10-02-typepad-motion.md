If you follow along with the web 2.0 news, you've probably already seen [the headlines](http://mashable.com/2009/10/01/typepad-motion/) that we introduced a couple of big things this week: the TypePad Platform and TypePad Motion. Huge congrats are in order for the entire team...which was actually two teams working closely together: the back-end team working on exposing key pieces of TypePad as a set of REST-based APIs, and the front-end team building a beautiful Django application for running simple, social connected communities that are powered by those TypePad APIs.

You can read more about [TypePad Motion](http://www.typepad.com/go/motion/), join the [developer program](http://developer.typepad.com/) and download the Django bits [from Github](http://github.com/blog/510-typepad-developer-platform). But for the high level overview the blogs are where it's at: Leah Culver has a [great post about what the team built](http://blog.leahculver.com/2009/10/typepad-motion.html), while [Chris Alden's post](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2009/10/typepad-platform-and-typepad-motion.html) puts all of this new stuff in broader Six Apart context.

I love working with this team, and bringing TypePad Motion to market -- with real sites running real software powering real communities -- has been a ton of fun. There's a lot more to do, of course, but that's always the way it is when you launch a product. Onwards!
