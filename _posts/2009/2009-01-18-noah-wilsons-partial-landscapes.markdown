<p>It was worth the trip to the <a href="http://www.headlands.org/">Headlands Center for the Arts</a> today to see the <em><a href="http://noahmwilson.com/landscapes.html">Partial Landscapes</a></em> drawings by Noah Wilson, in the <a href="http://www.headlands.org/event_detail.asp?key=20&amp;eventkey=390">Front and Center</a> show. If you find yourself out that way -- enjoying the beach, taking in the view or saving the baby seals at the Marine Mammal Center, stop in and check them out.  Here's one to tease you; they're obviously much better in person.</p>
