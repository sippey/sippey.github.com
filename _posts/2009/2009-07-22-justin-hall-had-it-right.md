_Justin Hall,_ [_what you need to make a responded site_](http://www.links.net/webpub/webergy.html)

I've been reading Scott Rosenberg's book _Say Everything_ and going on a bit of a nostalgia trip. And while everything is still mostly [Carl's fault](http://www.carlsteadman.com), the great stuff that's happening in social media, blogs, etc., traces back to what Justin Hall said back in 1996.
