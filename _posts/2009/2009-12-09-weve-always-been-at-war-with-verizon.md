So the head of AT&T's wireless unit [made news today](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/12/09/att-to-new-york-and-san-francisco-were-working-on-it/) for having the gall to admit that their networks in San Francisco and New York "are performing at levels below our standards." _(No, really?)_

But T's corp comm folks didn't see that as the news angle. As posted in an update to the WSJ piece linked above, their spokesman said:

> “Ralph de la Vega made significant news today in saying that, based on independent drive testing, we have 98.68 percent nationwide voice retainability, which means that the difference between AT&T and the industry leader is less than 2/10 of a percentage point on this important metric. That translates to a difference of less than 2 calls out of a thousand.”

Cue the map.
