If you haven't seen last night's Mad Men ep, I don't think this (from Tim Goodman's [morning recap](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/tgoodman/detail?blogid=24&entry_id=49367)) is much of a spoiler.

> And I suspect at least part of the exchange - the dismissive "you people" - was Weiner's way of reaffirming the idea that Don is not really a likable character (as David Chase had to do periodically with Tony on "The Sopranos"), as Don's cult of cool (good looks, great job, available women, constant drinking) begins to look pretty interesting from the couch.

I had the exact same thought last night. Weiner needs the audience to keep Don at arm's length...and that scene last night was the M.M. equivalent of Tony beating some guy's head in with a baseball bat.
