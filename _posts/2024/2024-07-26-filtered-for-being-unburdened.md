Barack Obama, [Our Endorsement](https://barackobama.medium.com/our-endorsement-7d5a82ce010e):

> But Kamala has more than a resume. She has the vision, the character, and the strength that this critical moment demands. There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people. At a time when the stakes have never been higher, she gives us all reason to hope.

Rebecca Traister, [The Case for Being Unburdened by What Has Been](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-thrill-of-taking-a-huge-risk-on-kamala-harris.html):

> I felt excited not in spite of my uncertainty, but because of it. I felt that our national political narrative was finally accurately mirroring our national reality: Everything is scary, we have never been here before, we don’t know if we can do this, and precisely because these stakes are so high, we are at last going to act like it, by taking unprecedented, untested, underpolled, creative measures to change, grow, and fight at a pitch that meets the gravity of the urgent, existentially important task in front of us. No more clinging to the walls of the past for safety, no more adhering to models or traditions or assumptions that the autocratic opposition has shown itself willing to explode over the past two decades in its own efforts to win.

[Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/07/kamala-harris-drives-record-fundraising-after-biden-exit/):

> Within 36 hours of Biden’s announcement on July 21, Harris raised more than $100 million, according to her campaign, including $81 million in the first 24 hours. The $100 million cash infusion would more than double the $96 million the Biden-Harris campaign had in cash on hand at the end of June. Harris’ team said the massive haul, which includes money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees, represents the largest 24-hour total in U.S. history. 

Let's fucking go.
