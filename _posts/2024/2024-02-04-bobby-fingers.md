Somehow I missed Andy Baio's post from May of last year, [The Unhinged Miniature World of Bobby Fingers](https://waxy.org/2023/05/the-unhinged-miniature-world-of-bobby-fingers/). As usual I'm late to this party.

> If you haven’t seen them before, Bobby Fingers makes elaborate 1:9 scale dioramas depicting embarrassing moments in the lives of famous men, showing off his talents in model-making with a range of techniques from Bronze Age wax casting to modern 3D laser scanning.

But I discovered Mr. Fingers' work today, thanks to Kevin Kelly's [tip in Recomendo](https://www.recomendo.com/p/drawzerquiet-places-finderon-the), who calls them "Dada YouTube." 

> His long videos are masterpieces of meticulous art craftsmanship, elaborate prank puzzles, indie music, deadpan comedy, all disguised as one of the best maker tutorials I’ve ever seen. It is very hard to describe their obsessive weirdness and elegant absurdity.

[Drunk Mel Gibson Arrest Diorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoHb0ziMDA&t=20s) is the best place to start, but [Michael Jackson on Fire Diorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHi479xN_po) deserves a spot in the contemporary canon alongside Jeff Koons' *[Michael Jackson and Bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_and_Bubbles)*.
