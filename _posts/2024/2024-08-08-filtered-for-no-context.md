Hey ChatGPT, write a sonnet based on these:

> In lands where dragons soar and legends rise,<br />
> A governor instructs in driving’s art.<br />
> Phyllis, a specter, dons a bold disguise,<br />
> Her laughter echoes, playing every part.
> 
> Medieval beats from times long past now play,<br />
> A symphony of dreams both strange and bright.<br />
> Forgotten realms in twilight’s soft decay,<br />
> Give way to tales that shimmer in the night.
> 
> Through apps that mimic friends, we find our way,<br />
> In digital embraces, cold and new.<br />
> Yet pink armadillos in the clay,<br />
> Remind us of the wonder that is true.
> 
> With letters penned and bicycles restored,<br />
> We craft our lives in worlds both real and scored.

OK, computer.
