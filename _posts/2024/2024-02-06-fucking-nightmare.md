[M.G. Siegler, Unchoking the Web](https://spyglass.org/unchoking-the-web/):

> It is absolutely not enjoyable to visit many websites of today. Especially content-focused websites which have become an absolute cesspool of obnoxious ads which at best distract from and often outright block the content. And that's if you can get the pages to load, which is a chore in and of itself because of all the scripts these pages are running to be able to glean more insight so as to get more information to serve up said shitty ads. It's a fucking nightmare.

Arc Search is currently my default mobile browser for three reasons: 

1. It opens right to the search experience.
2. The "let's make a web page for you" is a clever solution to a real problem that M.G. so correctly outlines.
3. The whole experience is just delightful.
