It’s too easy to blame external forces for the declines in trust and simple prestige of the news industry. There’s groupthink that tends to coalesce around a singular point of view. This got exacerbated during Trump and a generational shift toward a form of activism that’s been embedded in journalism for a while but has become heightened in recent years. Speaking truth to power became “calling out” various transgressions. The moralizing over dumb tweets did the profession no favors.
