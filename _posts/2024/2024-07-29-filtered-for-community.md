Heather Cox Richardson on how like bankruptcy, even [democracy happens gradually and then suddenly](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/july-28-2024):

> Every time we expand democracy, it seems we get complacent, thinking it’s a done deal. We forget that democracy is a process and that it’s never finished.
> 
> And when we get complacent, people who want power use our system to take over the government. They get control of the Senate, the White House, and the Supreme Court, and they begin to undermine the principle that we should be treated equally before the law and to chip away at the idea that we have a right to a say in our government. And it starts to seem like we have lost our democracy. 
> 
> But all the while, there are people who keep the faith. Lawmakers, of course, but also **teachers and journalists and the musicians who push back against the fear by reminding us of love and family and community**. And in those communities, people begin to organize—the marginalized people who are the first to feel the bite of reaction, and grassroots groups. They keep the embers of democracy alive.
> 
> And then something fans them into flame. 

Emphasis mine. And sort of related, today's [Red Hand Files from Nick Cave](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/thoughts-about-loneliness/), answering a question about loneliness:

> Philosopher, neuroscientist and psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says we require three things to attain a meaningful life. The first is feeling part of a wider community – family, friends, and society in general. Second is an understanding of nature and a connection to the natural order of things, which McGilchrist feels we have largely lost. Finally, we need to form a relationship with the sacred or divine – this can be found in art, music, poetry and religion, where we acknowledge the ineffable and all-encompassing force that holds the world together.
