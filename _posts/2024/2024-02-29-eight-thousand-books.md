[Colin Ainsworth, in the Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/02/29/fixer-upper-larry-mcmurtrys-library/), visits Chip and Joanna Gaines' new hotel in Waco, which has been outfitted with the thousands and thousands of books they bought from Larry McMurtry.

> In the library, I get as close to the shelves as I can and tilt my head to read the spines. There’s a copy of Moby-Dick just over the railing of the stairs. I look down over the library to see if taking it  off the shelf is kosher. I don’t see anyone with a book, but I also don’t see any security or anyone telling me I’m about to do something wrong. I grab it and flip through it, still conscious that someone might be watching, and when I really realize that no one is paying attention, it occurs to me that I could walk out of this hotel with this book right now: Larry McMurtry’s personal copy of Moby-Dick, or at least, one from his bookstore, could be mine. I text a couple of friends this idea before I put the book back on the shelf.
