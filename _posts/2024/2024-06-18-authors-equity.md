[Rebind](https://rebind.ai/) recipe: combine one part Project Gutenberg, one part Chat GPT, two parts Masterclass, add a healthy dash of pretense, mix well. I don't buy the "director's commentary" metaphor (the Rebind experts, like John Banville, aren't the "directors" in this movie), but I am really into using LLMs to help people dig deeper into difficult material. 

Related: I hadn't really been paying attention to [Authors Equity](https://authorsequity.com/), but in his newsletter a few days ago James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits* and an investor in Authors Equity) announced that Seth Godin is publishing his next book there, and Joseph Nguyen signed with them to distribute his best selling *Don't Believe Everything You Think*. The biggest difference between AE and traditional publishers? Profit sharing. From their [FAQ](https://authorsequity.substack.com/p/frequently-asked-questions): "We work with a joint venture/profit share model, paying no advance but offering a much higher per-unit payout to the authors we work with."
