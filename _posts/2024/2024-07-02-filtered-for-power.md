description: "It corrupts!"

I'm a couple of weeks behind on this one, but [this letter from Donald Sutherland to *Hunger Games* director Gary Ross](https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/power-corrupts) about the character of President Coriolanus Snow is pitch perfect.

> Power. That’s what this is about? Yes? Power and the forces that are manipulated by the powerful men and bureaucracies trying to maintain control and possession of that power? Power perpetrates war and oppression to maintain itself until it finally topples over with the bureaucratic weight of itself and sinks into the pages of history (except in Texas), leaving lessons that need to be learned unlearned.

Heather Cox Richardson, [July 1, 2024](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/july-1-2024):

> Today the United States Supreme Court overthrew the central premise of American democracy: that no one is above the law. It decided that the president of the United States, possibly the most powerful person on earth, has “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for crimes committed as part of the official acts at the core of presidential powers. The court also said it should be presumed that the president also has immunity for other official acts as well, unless that prosecution would not intrude on the authority of the executive branch.

Mara Quint, [Supreme Court-Approved Ways to Celebrate the Fourth of July](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/supreme-court-approved-ways-to-celebrate-the-fourth-of-july):

> Representational democracy had a good run, but the Supreme Court has finally rediscovered the founders’ original intent. Sure, they were against kings, but it turns out, after 248 years, we had completely misunderstood that they actually liked when someone has the powers of a king; they just didn’t like the word “king.” It rhymes with too many other words and leaves the nation open to getting absolutely destroyed in a rap battle. With “president,” you just have “resident,” “hesitant,” and maybe “negligent,” but that’s sort of a stretch.
