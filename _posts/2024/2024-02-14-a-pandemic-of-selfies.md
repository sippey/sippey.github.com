> Specialist insurer Hiscox has reported a trend of selfie-taking visitors damaging valuable paintings, objects, and installations by walking into them backward. ... Hiscoxâ€™s head of art and private clients, Robert Read, dubbed the phenomenon **"a pandemic of selfies,"** as the consequences are happening at prominent art institutions across the globe.

Emphasis mine, because "a pandemic of selfies" is the perfect collective noun.
