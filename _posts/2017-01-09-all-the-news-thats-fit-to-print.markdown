What happened to "all the news that's fit to print?" Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes calling out Trump for bullying a _Times reporter_ was clearly news. Did the Times need to call Trump to get his response? Sure. Did they need to print it? No. Because his response was not news.

Jason Kottke nails it in his post <a href="http://kottke.org/17/01/meryl-streep-on-our-current-political-moment">this morning</a>:

> Is it newsworthy, what he thought of Streep’s remarks? Unless he agrees with her and plans to honestly reevaluate how he treats others when he speaks, I would argue it’s not at all worth printing what’s essentially a Trump press release full of bullshit. And news outlets that actually care about the truth and not just printing spin should stop doing it.

I can't  watch television news anymore, but I have to wonder if anyone is pairing Trump's tweets this morning with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZcuWba_HgU">clip of him from his rally in November</a>.
