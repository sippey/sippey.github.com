<p>It&#39;s the summer of travel. Enjoying the week in Chicago with my family and seeing some friends. I love this city...especially when the lake isn&#39;t frozen.</p>

<p>Everyone here can&#39;t stop talking about Groupon. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve spent so much time in the Bay Area, but I&#39;m kind of blasé now about companies with astronomical valuations that everyone thinks will crash and burn. What I&#39;ve been arguing is that while Groupon&#39;s (creative) financials may not be able to support its current valuation, it&#39;s all about execution over the long term. There&#39;s still a ton of opportunity to use the Internet to create value for retail businesses, and if Groupon can hook them with efficient (and profitable) marketing / demand generation, then follow on products and services could end up being massive. The bankers may be playing the short game, but the company&#39;s playing long ball. <em>(Hey look, mixed sports metaphor in a sports town!) </em>&#0160;But they&#39;ll need to develop a technology / product advantage so that they don&#39;t have to compete on the size of their email list, the size of their sales force...or the cleverness of their copy.</p>
