<p>And two makes a trend! Last month Berg London (yep, <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2011/08/the-opposite-of-camouflage.html">them again</a>) published <a href="http://berglondon.com/products/svk/">SVK</a>, a comic from Warren Ellis and Matt Brooker. A critical piece of the story line is printed with invisible ink that you can only read with the "SVK object," a UV light source that's packaged with the book. I had a chance to see it in person when I was <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2011/06/in-london.html">in London</a> and it's very, very cool. The technique is integrated into the plot in a way that rewards the reader for investing the effort in reading in a new way.</p>

<p>On Friday, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/08/05/mcsweeneys-keep-our-secrets/">via Brainpickings</a> comes news of a fall children's title from McSweeney's that features heat-sensitive invisible ink. The preview video is fun, and gives you a sense of what it's like to rub the pages to reveal what's underneath...</p>

<p>More like this please. And there's a lesson in here for designers that are crafting screen-based interactivity on top of classically narrative content: make sure the distraction and the effort that's required for readers to push, click, highlight, scrub, type, shake, tilt, etc. <em>is worth it</em>. If you're going to entice the reader out of their state of reading "flow," then make sure what you want them to do adds to their experience of your content.</p>
