Clay Shirky pens [a paean to Wikipedia](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jan/14/wikipedia-unplanned-miracle-10-years "Go read it.") on the occasion of its 10th birthday. I like this bit: "Wikipedia is best understood not as a product with an organisation behind it, but as an activity that happens to leave an encyclopedia in its wake." I wonder how well you could apply this thinking to other forms of media.Â Thought experiment: "The New York Times / Gawker / 30 Rock / the TED Conference is best understood not as a product, but as an activity that happens to leave ______________ in its wake." And then use that frame of reference to generate a list of related activities.
