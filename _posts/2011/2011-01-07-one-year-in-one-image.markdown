Via [Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/06/one_year_in_one_image), Eirik Solheim's [One year in one image](http://eirikso.com/2011/01/04/one-year-in-one-image/), which is a year-long timelapse view out his window in Oslo, Norway, sliced into a single image. It'd be cheating for me to post the image here; go check it out on his site for the full context and to learn what's next with the images he has.
