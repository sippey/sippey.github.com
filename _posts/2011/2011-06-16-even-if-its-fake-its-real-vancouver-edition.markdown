<p>Getty Images photographer Rich Lam, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/vancouver-riots-2011-photo-5929916">at Esquire</a>, on the kissing couple in the middle of the Vancouver riots last night:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was complete chaos. Rioters set two cars on fire and then I saw looters break the window at a neighboring department store. At that point, the riot police charged right towards us. After I stopped running, I noticed in the space behind the line of police that two people were laying in the street with the riot police and a raging fire just beyond them. I knew I had captured a "moment" when I snapped the still forms against the backdrop of such chaos but it wasn't until later when I returned to the rink to file my photos that my editor pointed out that the two people were not hurt, but kissing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Remember kids, even if it's fake, it's real.
