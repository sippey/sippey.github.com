<p><a href="http://www.panmacmillan.com/">Pan Macmillan</a> is republishing Don DeLillo's back catalog, with new covers commissioned from <a href="http://www.newstudiolondon.com/">New Studio London</a> with illustrations by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noma_Bar">Noma Bar</a>. They're not only beautiful, but highly evocative of the books themes and major plot points.</p>

<p>If you're a DeLillo fan, you'll want to take my "match the title to the cover" quiz. I whipped it up this morning, cropping the title from each of the books. </p>

<p>If you're really good, you won't need the answer key. But if you need to cheat, check out the <a href="http://www.newstudiolondon.com/#dondelillo">grid of covers</a> at New Studio London's site.</p>
