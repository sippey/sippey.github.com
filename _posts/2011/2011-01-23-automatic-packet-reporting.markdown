<p>I love learning about entire communications networks that I had no idea existed. Case in point: <a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/good/aprs.html" target="_self">Nelson Minar blogs about APRS</a>, the Automatic Packet Reporting System. &#0160;&quot;APRS lets you send short messages from a handheld radio to the Internet through the simple expedient of broadcast and repeat.&quot;</p>
<p>More info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">from Wikipedia</a>:  &quot;In its simplest implementation, APRS is used to transmit real-time data, information and reports of the exact location of a person or object via a data signal sent over amateur radio frequencies. In addition to real-time position reporting capabilities using attached Global Positioning System receivers, APRS is also capable of transmitting a wide variety of data, including weather reports, short text messages, radio direction finding bearings, telemetry data, short e-mail messages (send only) and storm forecasts.&quot;</p>
<p>Read Nelson&#39;s post for more info; fascinating.</p>
