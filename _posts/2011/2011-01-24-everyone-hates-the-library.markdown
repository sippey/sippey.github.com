Via [Jessamyn West](http://www.librarian.net/stax/3475/why-would-anyone-hate-the-library-amy-poehler-explains/) comes this great [Amy Poehler interview](http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/01/q-la-amy-poehler.html) where she talks about how people who work in local governments really do hate the library.  "People who work in the library think they are so much better than everyone else. And what’s really funny is we’ve been doing Q&A’s about our show, and people from local governments have said, 'You guys nailed it about the library.' We were just making it up as a joke on the show, but I guess everyone hates the library."
