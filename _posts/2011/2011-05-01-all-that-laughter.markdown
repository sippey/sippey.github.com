<p>So all the laughter and enthusiastic applause at the Correspondents&#39; Dinner tonight when the President <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=564s">skewered Donald Trump</a>...wasn&#39;t that coming from the same people who covered the birthers and made the whole story line possible?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=564s" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Correspondents" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0154320d4642970c image-full" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0154320d4642970c-800wi" title="Correspondents" /></a></p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
