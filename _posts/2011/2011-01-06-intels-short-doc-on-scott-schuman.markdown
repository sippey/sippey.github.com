<p>I really like this short documentary about <a href="http://www.thesartorialist.blogspot.com/" target="_self">The Sartorialist</a>&#39;s Scott Schuman that Intel made to support their <a href="http://www.intel.com/visuallife/" target="_self">Visual Life</a> campaign.</p>

<p>This is good. Not only is this a major brand&#39;s documentary <em>about a blogger</em>,&#0160;he&#39;s also ruggedly handsome, New York looks great, there&#39;s a cool &quot;projected images from a moving vehicle&quot; thing, and there&#39;s a great moment where two women he&#39;s photographing on the street don&#39;t recognize him...until one of them does.&#0160;</p>
<p>Someone was very busy over the holidays, because this was published this week and the folks you seem him shooting on the street were featured on the blog <a href="http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2010/12/on-streetchinatown-new-york.html" target="_self">right before Christmas</a>.</p>
