I really like this short documentary about [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.blogspot.com/)'s Scott Schuman that Intel made to support their [Visual Life](http://www.intel.com/visuallife/) campaign.

This is good. Not only is this a major brand's documentary _about a blogger_, he's also ruggedly handsome, New York looks great, there's a cool "projected images from a moving vehicle" thing, and there's a great moment where two women he's photographing on the street don't recognize him...until one of them does. 

Someone was very busy over the holidays, because this was published this week and the folks you seem him shooting on the street were featured on the blog [right before Christmas](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/2010/12/on-streetchinatown-new-york.html).
