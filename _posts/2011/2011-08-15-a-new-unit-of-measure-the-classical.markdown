<p>If we're measuring tech startup funding in units of "Color" (as in, what fraction of a Color round did you raise?), we should now be measuring new content ventures in units of "Classicals."  The Classical is a <s>non-existent</s> pre-launch <s>sports blog</s> daily web publication about sports that's using <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101341727/the-classical">Kickstarter</a> to raise $50,000. </p>

  <p><strong>Entrepreneditor</strong>:  We have a vision to dominate the {{ INSERT VERTICAL HERE }} space with a mix of first-person content, long-form essays, quick Tumblr-style blog posts, service journalism, slideshows, how-to videos, innovative community features and a viral social strategy.</p>

  <p><strong>Investor</strong>: How much are you looking to raise?</p>

  <p><strong>Entrepreneditor</strong>:  Only two Classicals.</p>
