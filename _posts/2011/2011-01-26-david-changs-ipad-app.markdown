[David Chang is doing a quarterly iPad app](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/david-changs-latest-an-ipad-app-and-a-journal/) (and print journal), where each issue will go deep into a single dish. "The ramen app will include a tour of a ramen factory in Japan; an interview with Allan Benton, the Tennessee smokehouse master whose bacon is used in the broth; a consultation with Harvard food scientists about Mr. Chang’s efforts to make a pork-based variant of dashi; a talk by Harold McGee (green-screened into outer space) on hot broth’s effects on noodles; and a scrollable time line tracing the rise of ramen in Japan over the last century. There will also be appearances by Wylie Dufresne, Charlie Rose and Anthony Bourdain, and plenty of cooking demonstrations." More like this, please. (Literally.)
