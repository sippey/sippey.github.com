At Frog's blog, David Sherwin is sharing challenges from his book [Creative Workshop: 80 Challenges to Sharpen Your Design Skills](http://amzn.to/gwCsnv). I like this first one, a [little challenge](http://designmind.frogdesign.com/blog/design-challenge-thinking-outside-the-wrist.html) to rethink the most popular piece of wearable tech...the watch.

> For one week, keep a diary about time. Every day, as you interact with your watch, phone, computer, or clock, write down how you feel when you check the time. When the week is up, use the data that you gathered to design a “watch” prototype that redefines how people keep track of time—both in their day-to-day life, and in their pursuit of fashion. You can only take two hours to design the prototype.

I have no time to do this.
