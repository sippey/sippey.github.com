Matt Webb, who is my 2011 blog muse, has a great post up about [UFO on Tape, Dance Central and the whole thing around augmented(ish) reality](http://interconnected.org/home/2011/01/26/ufo_on_tape) that's happening with some iPhone appgames and XBox Kinect. Worth reading in full. "It's not super high tech or dramatic or woo-woo-flashy like the Minority Report interface. I don't know what to call it. But it's nice and humble and human, and I like it."
