<p>Via <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/?p=4677">Things</a>&#0160;comes&#0160;<a href="http://www.makedo.com.au/">makedo</a>:&#0160;&quot;a set of connectors for creating things from the stuff around you.&quot; The projects in their galleries look amazing, of course, and make me want to order some of these for the munchkins.</p>
<p>There has to be a name for this product category: the &quot;you really don&#39;t need this product, but it provides enough structure and inspiration to kickstart what you otherwise wouldn&#39;t have done on your own at home left to your own devices on a rainy day&quot; category.</p>
