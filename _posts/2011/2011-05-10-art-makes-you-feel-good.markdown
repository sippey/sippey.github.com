<p>Across the wire comes news that scientists have found that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8500012/Brain-scans-reveal-the-power-of-art.html" target="_self">art makes you feel good</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We put people in a scanner and showed them a series of paintings every ten seconds. We then measured the change in blood flow in one part of the brain.&#0160;The reaction was immediate. What we found was the increase in blood flow was in proportion to how much the painting was liked.&#0160;The blood flow increased for a beautiful painting just as it increases when you look at somebody you love. It tells us art induces a feel good sensation direct to the brain.</p>

<p>Awww. So sweet. I think we should have some <a href="http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/nauman/card2.html">Clown Torture</a> to celebrate.</p>
