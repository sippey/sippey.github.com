<p>Jeff Bezos' <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2011/04/the_amazoncom_2010_shareholder.html" target="_self">2010 letter to Amazon shareholders</a> goes in-depth on their technology, covering service oriented architectures, state management, topic modeling, object caching, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the effort we put into technology might not matter that much if we kept technology off to the side in some sort of R&amp;D department, but we don't take that approach. Technology infuses all of our teams, all of our processes, our decision-making, and our approach to innovation in each of our businesses. It is deeply integrated into everything we do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth reading in full. There's nothing in here that should be a surprise to anyone that's paid attention to Amazon's technology over the years, but the letter signals the depth of commitment that Amazon has to ongoing R&amp;D. It's a reminder from Bezos to Wall Street: "Hey, you know what's been driving our growth over the last five years? This stuff. And we're not letting up."</p>
