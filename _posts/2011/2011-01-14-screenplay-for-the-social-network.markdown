Sony Pictures has posted a PDF of [Aaron Sorkin's screenplay for The Social Network](http://flash.sonypictures.com/video/movies/thesocialnetwork/awards/thesocialnetwork_screenplay.pdf). It reads as well as you'd think it would; but if you've seen the movie it's impossible not to see the film's action in your mind's eye as you make your way through it. Like a blueprint of an existing building, it's a plan for a thing that's already made its way into the world. Once you've seen the building, it can't be read purely as the plan.
