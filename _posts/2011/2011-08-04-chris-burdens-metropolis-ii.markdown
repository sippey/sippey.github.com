<p>One of my favorite exhibitions was MOCA's 1992 show <a href="http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/3374">Helter Skelter: LA Art in the 1990s</a>. I was young(er) and impressionable, and it opened up my eyes to what contemporary art can be. The centerpiece of that show was Chris Burden's <em><a href="http://nialldebuitlear.com/blog/?p=462">Medusa Head</a></em> (<a href="http://www.sippey.com/2011/07/polystyrene-orb.html">referenced recently</a>), a hanging sculpture, 14 feet in diameter, made of plywood, steel, cement, rock...and model railroad trains and tracks.</p>

<p>Burden's topped Medusa's Head with <em>Metropolis II</em>, a new kinetic sculpture that's <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/?p=4728">on its way to LACMA</a>. It features 1,200 custom-designed toy cars traveling through 18 lanes around a fabricated city. You have to see it to believe it...so here's the preview.</p>

<p><em>Metropolis II</em> is a follow up to <em>Metropolis I</em>, which only had two single-lane highways and 80 Hot Wheels cars. It was purchased by a Japanese contemporary art museum.</p>

<p>Who's up for a trip to L.A.?</p>
