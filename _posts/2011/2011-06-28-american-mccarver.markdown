<p>Very happy to announce the launch of <a href="http://americanmccarver.com/">American McCarver</a>, the group sports blog I'm contributing to along with Catalano, Gruber, Knauss, Michaels, Monteiro, Snell and more to come.</p>

<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://americanmccarver.com"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef01538f7e9162970b" title="American-mccarver" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef01538f7e9162970b-500wi" alt="American-mccarver" /></a></p>

<p>It's good company to be in. As my friend Mat Honan <a href="http://twitter.com/mat/status/85462773106089984">tweeted</a>, "Wow, so this is an all-star lineup. I mean, except for @sippey." Couldn't have said it better myself. Humor me, though, and go read the post I wrote when we were in double secret beta, about <a href="http://americanmccarver.com/post/6328064854/dfw-and-fed">David Foster Wallace and Roger Federer</a>.</p>

<p>Also, kudos to Monteiro for the brilliant touch of cycling through classic McCarverisms in the header, like my favorite "It's better to have a fast runner on base than a slow one." Couldn't agree more.</p>
