Dave Pell has a great post about how social media (oh God I want a new name for this stuff so badly) turns us into [salespeople for ourselves](http://tweetagewasteland.com/2011/01/now-sellng-on-the-web-you/). "The social web changes the entire selling equation. Thereâ€™s no more emotional friction associated with a sales job. The age of subtlety is dead. So we all push the product nonstop and **the product is us**." Emphasis mine.
