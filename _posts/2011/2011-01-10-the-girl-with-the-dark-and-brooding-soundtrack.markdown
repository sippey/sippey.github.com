Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross will score the soundtrack to the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I liked this bit from [Pitchfork's note](http://pitchfork.com/news/41150-trent-reznor-and-atticus-ross-to-score-david-finchers-ithe-girl-with-the-dragon-tattooi/)...

> The book, which has already been made into a successful Swedish movie, delves into some very dark territory, which means Reznor should be right at home.

Ayup.
