Dick Costolo -- always on the cutting edge ot set theory -- is at the vanguard of a growing movement to [bring back the Venn diagram](http://www.burningdoor.com/dick/archives/000268.html "802.11me: The Return of the Venn Diagram"). In the comments, Marc Rettig has posed a most excellent question: "are all assholes really irrationally disconsolate?" And I have an issue with his _labeling_ of the set "the intentionally evil or ignorant," but not with one of the set's [members](http://www.riaa.com/).
