It's official. Kenneth Baker in [today's Art Notes](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/25/DDGFC38G5I1.DTL):

> Traywick transforming: The Traywick Gallery in Berkeley will close its 10th Street location when its current show of work by Johnna Arnold and Dennis Begg ends Nov. 29.
> 
> But the business will reopen soon, with the same Web address (www.traywick.com) and phone numbers, as Traywick Contemporary. Proprietor Katrina Traywick wants to break out of the storefront mold to work on various kinds of projects with artists she represents, including shows by appointment only and special events in temporary public venues.
> 
> The East Bay can ill afford the loss of a reliable showplace for contemporary art, but at least Paulson Press has taken over the space adjacent to the one Traywick has occupied for six years.

Note: the date above should have read Nov. 22. It's been a great six years in the public space -- and here's to new things!
