Three related things from this morning's news bin. First, David Weinberger's [writeup](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002089.html) of Lessig's talk at POPTECH. I heard Lessig last week (or the week before last?) at SFMOMA, giving what seems to be a similar talk, tuned for the art crowd. The refrain was "free culture," where free was used both as an adjective and a verb. Second, Denise Howell's [writeup](http://bgbg.blogspot.com/archives/2003_10_12_bgbg_archive.html#106640657876220489) of Doctorow and Dyson's panel at Digital ID World. Agree with the danger of unintended consequences of captured data (enforcing privacy policies is a _human_ problem, not a technology problem), but find the potential RFID use case of smart furniture just a _tad_ far-fetched. Third, Werbach on [what is Internet infrastructure](http://werbach.com/blog/2003/10/17.html#a1267), which reminds me that end-to-enders need more case studies like Akamai to prove commercial viability of building smart apps on top of the dumb infrastructure instead of the other way around.
