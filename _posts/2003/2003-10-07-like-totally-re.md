The recall shocker is that Schwarzenegger appears to have won with more than 50% of the vote. He only needed a plurality; despite the yard-long list of candidates on the ballots, the actor was able to command a majority of the electorate in an battle that saw record-high voter turnout. Arnold, for better or worse, appears to have a mandate. One could argue whether this is in spite of or as a result of the issue-free personality-driven campaign.
