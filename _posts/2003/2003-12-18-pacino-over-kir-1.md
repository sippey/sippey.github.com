As if we needed confirmation that the Hollywood Foreign Press is completely out to lunch: Pacino got the miniseries actor nomination for _Angels in America_ instead of Justin Kirk. Pacino's Roy Cohn was _very_ Pacino -- bugeyed, raw, vocal and engaging, to be sure. But Kirk's Prior Walter was masterful; you couldn't ask for more subtle, nuanced and emotionally rich acting. His soliloquy address to the continental principalities ("_addicted_ to life") and the final scene in Central Park will stay with me for _months._
