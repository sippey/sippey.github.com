Nokia's [introduced](http://adweek.com/aw/regional/southwest/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2056335) a limited edition version of the 3300 music phone, with a preloaded version of Jay-Z's _Black Album_. Never mind that the phone would be _much_ better if it came preloaded Prince's _Black Album_ \-\- this is something like a marketing strategy for the iPod I [wrote about](http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html) in July...

> An iPod that's shipped with, say, 250 pre-loaded tracks offers rich opportunities for market segmentation, channel diversification (sell the country iPod in the guns and ammo section of Wal-Mart?), device customization (through store.apple.com) and price point differentiation.

(I'm just quoting myself all over the place today.)
