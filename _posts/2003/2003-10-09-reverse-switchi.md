Apple [launching iTunes for Windows](http://news.com.com/2100-1027_3-5088849.html?tag=nefd_top) could be the app that pushes me to a reverse switch on my machine at home. It's the only iApp that's keeping me on the platform -- I'm not doing enough movie making to care about iMovie; iPhoto's a dog compared to [Photoshop Album](http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.09.24.html) \-\- and there are enough benefits on the other side (commodity hardware, integration with the tools we use at work) to make a $500 decision to buy a new PC an easier one than an $1800 decision to upgrade our aging iMac.
