Part of the genius of Sofia Coppola's _Lost in Translation_ was her ability to insert two subtle Bill Murray pop-culture (self)references and have them actually _enhance_ the emotional tone of the movie rather than crush it under the knowing wink of irony. Exhibit A: the man who essentially [wrote the book](http://snl.jt.org/char.php?i=394 "snl archives : nick the lounge singer") on over-the-top lounge singers doing a delicate karaoke rendition of Roxy Music's _More Than This_. Exhibit B: the audience connecting the dots between the younger Murray on the golf course [in 1980](http://imdb.com/title/tt0080487/) with the elder Murray stepping up to a Mt. Fuji-framed tee and hitting a picture-perfect drive with a picture-perfect swing.
