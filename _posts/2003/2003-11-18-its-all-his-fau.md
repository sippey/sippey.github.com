So Jason's gone and [redesigned](http://www.kottke.org/03/11/kottke-redesign) Kottke.org, integrating all his content into one column, with all sorts of tricks to have movie reviews, book reviews, "classic" posts, remaindered links, etc., appear in-line but with mini-templates of their own. All of which is great, of course...I mean who doesn't love the big K?

Then why do I have this nagging feeling that someday we will all return to the talismanic ur-format of [freedonia.com/~carl](http://freedonia.com/~carl/ "that goddamned microstar again."), where everything's on one page, all scrollable, searchable (CTRL+F, anyone?) and even permalinked for user-friendliness. Categories? Context-providing Google links? Comments? Revenue producing reading lists? Micro-ads? Daily, weekly and monthly archives? Feh. It's all about the output.

Remember, kids: this is [all his fault](http://carlsteadman.com/). _All_ of it. I blame Carl, and [you should too](http://www.rageboy.com/carlshead.html "especially if you're into friendster -- five years ago carl messes with six degrees by inviting everyone as his life partner.").
