Reason #654 to love eBay: [Collection of 26 Beanie Babies from Ex-Wife](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3146042998).

> I know nothing about these stuffed Beanie Babies. I offer no proof of anything. It is a stuffed animal, get over it! I don't think my ex-wife was in the Black Market Beanie Trade...but then again, I didn't know she was having an affair either!
