Naval Ravikant [injects some sense](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000194.html) into the current blog-o-meme about the supposed "death of email."

> Sure, a few, tech-savvy people will get frustrated and try and use a different mechanism. Many will use webs of trusted whitelists (think sixdegrees on your address book) or challenge-response systems. A few will storm off to some new, secure communications mechanism, that authenticates senders and imposes a true cost on them. Even fewer will migrate to wholly new paradigms like "shared workspaces."

(Just to be clear, I most certainly have [a stake](http://www.quris.com/) in the future of the inbox.)
