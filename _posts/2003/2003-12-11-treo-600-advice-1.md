Useful Tip #2 of the day (where Michael realizes his new role in the blogowhatever). If you're using a Treo 600 on Sprint, go download Handspring's [beta email app](http://support.handspring.com/esupport/forms/hsResolutionView.jsp?Reso lutionId=9444&lstProducts=4442). It's free, and overcomes a significant limitation in the otherwise more fully-featured Snappermail; Handspring's app allows you to attach photos directly from the Treo's in-memory picture database, instead of requiring you to first move the photos to an SD card, a step that pretty much killed the spontaneity of emailing off a pic.

Tomorrow, maybe some cooking and house cleaning tips. I'm on a roll, here.
