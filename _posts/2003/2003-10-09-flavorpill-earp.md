[Flavorpill Productions](http://www.flavorpill.net/) deliver some of the best looking email newsletters around, and do a fantastic job of integrating their sponsors into the content. They've just launched [earplug](http://www.earplug.cc/), "a newsletter dedicated to electronic music and its many dynamic styles and influences." As you may [imagine](http://www.quris.com/), I've subscribed to dozens upon dozens of email programs, and Flavorpill's messages stand apart in my inbox and regularly get read. Not deleted, not filtered, not skimmed -- _read._ Go subscribe.
