Haughey launched [PVRBlog](http://www.pvrblog.com/) less than three months ago. It's already such a popular resource for information about digital video recorders that the PR folks from [MovieBeam](http://moviebeam.com/flashindex.jsp) offered up an exec for an [email interview](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2003/10/interview_with_.html). And oh yeah, the site [makes money](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features.blah/entry/007472), too.
