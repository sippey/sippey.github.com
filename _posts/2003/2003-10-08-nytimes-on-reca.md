The New York Times has a fantastic Flash [infographic](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/08/national/nationalspecial3/08MOOD.html) that shows, by county, results of the recall, the replacement race, the voting systems used in each county, and the results of the 2002 race between Davis and Bill Simon. Instead of a geographic map, though, I'd love to see this data presented in a [map of the market](http://smartmoney.com/maps/?nav=DropTabs)-style grid, where the size of the boxes represented the voting population, and the results were shaded based on the ratio of votes for and against the recall...
