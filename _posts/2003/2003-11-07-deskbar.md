I know it's beta, but why the heck does the [Google deskbar](http://toolbar.google.com/deskbar/) waste so much real estate in its result set by insisting on showing the Google logo and nav? The design intent of the tool is right on: provide fast, reasonably unobtrusive access to Google services in a keyboard-friendly manner. They nailed the taskbar component, but need to refine the search results component by developing a custom results page that (a) optimizes screen real estate and (b) leverages the keyboard-friendly nature of the rest of the app. Personally, I'm hoping for an alternate UI that ditches the browser component and displays results in a richer client...
