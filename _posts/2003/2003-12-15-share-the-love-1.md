Why I just opted out of Amazon's "share the love" program: I'm tired of receiving "look at how smart I am for purchasing this book, I thought I'd share this fact with the rest of the world!" messages gussied up as 10% off promotional offers. Like "George" actually cares enough to send me a 10% discount on The History of Iraq*. Puh-lease.
