There's a [new version](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=191540) of POPFile out, which promises to dramatically improve performance (it's never been that slow for me), through a migration the corpus from a flat text file to a BerkeleyDB database. But this caught my eye...

> In a future version POPFile will add official support for message classification through the SMTP and NNTP (Usenet news) protocols.

POPFile + nntp//rss, anyone?
