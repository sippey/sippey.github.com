Jeremy Allaire [posts](http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/08.html#a246) about [Flash Paper](http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/08.html#a246), a Macromedia alternative to Adobe's PDF. While I agree with the notion that we need alternatives to the ever-bloating PDF monster, Macromedia's missing a key user modality with digital documents -- email attachments. PDFs get saved, forwarded, marked up, forwarded on again, reused, repurposed, in a way that web-bound Flash paper documents couldn't... Even if Macromedia gave away the Flash paper producer (unlike Adobe, which charges a hefty sum for it), they'd need to be in bed with the [intranet](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/) / [workspace](http://www.lotus.com/) providers to make sharing those docs as easy as emailing an attachment...and then they'd _still_ have a problem with offline use and heavy inbox addicts...
