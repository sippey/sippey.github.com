Eight links in four minutes. (Yeah, I used to run one of those sideblogs, but what a frickin' _chore_ that was.)

*   [DigDB Excel Add-in Toolkit](http://www.digdb.com/). Overcome the massive shortcoming in Excel (otherwise probably the best product Microsoft's ever released) that prevents you from calculating a median inside a pivot table.
*   [Kottke's Matrix Revolutions thread](http://www.kottke.org/03/11/the-matrix-revolutions). My theory? Neo's now the Oracle.
*   [Dick Costolo cracks the Hollywood code](http://www.burningdoor.com/dick/archives/000215.html). Secrets revealed!
*   [The Hub: Intersections of Interaction Design](http://hub.interaction-ivrea.it/). Go Molly, go.
*   [Secret Santa has returned!](http://www.thinkblank.com/santa2003/) "Dear Friend, the concept is so easy / Pull names from hats and buy a gift! / Something tasteful - (not too sleazy) / Is sure to make their spirits lift..." (I'm clearly in need of more websites that rhyme.)
*   [New Sony Vaio TR2](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=T2DqRyBeXT7qfh_qbhrgTG9ReoOWR5PE1AQ=?CategoryName=pr_p_newcentrinonotebook_cpu&ProductSKU=PCGTR2AP1). Small is beautiful.
*   [MT.el](http://www.marginalia.org/code/mt.el): abuse the metaweblog API right from emacs.
*   [Covertec cases for the Treo 600](http://www.mobileplanet.com/private/covertec/product.asp?unit=H.T600). Love the device, debating the case.
