Jason Kottke [interviews](http://www.kottke.org/05/02/golf-gti-commercial-and-elsewhere) one of the dancers in the Golf GTI commercial that caused my jaw to drop violently.

> I didn't have to change my dancing stylistically at all. They wanted me to dance the way that I dance. In fact they had us watch the original Singing in the Rain scene so many times that I started unconsciously moving a bit like Gene Kelly. The director at one point even told me that I was moving too much like Gene and I needed to move more like me.

Worth reading.
