I know I must stop this nostalgicizing (I'm absolutely _sure_ that's a word, dagummit), but many thanks to Sir Owen Thomas for the pointer to [suckcom](http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=suckcom), the syndicated account on LJ that's retreading suck.com, nine years later.  If suckcom were your pal friend, you'd be having serendipitous moments like this one:  seeing that nine years ago Stewart Brand was the [netmogul card](http://suck.com/netmoguls/96/08/16/front.html), and then reading that [The Well's up for sale](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-5835759.html)!
