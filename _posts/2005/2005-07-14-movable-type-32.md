In case you haven't heard, the [beta of Movable Type 3.2 is available](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/beta/). It's an open beta, so if you're at all inclined, go grab and install it. For info on what's new, Anil and Jay have been running a series on the Six Apart ProNet blog titled "[Our 32 Favorite features in Movable Type 3.2](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2005/06/movable_type_32_is_comin.html)." They're through 12 of the 32; only 20 more features to go... Congrats to the team for hitting this milestone.
