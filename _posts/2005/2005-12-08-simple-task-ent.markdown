<p>Use Outlook?&nbsp; Love keeping todo lists, but hate the default task entry screen UI?&nbsp; Following some version of the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">gtd mantra</a>, and foregoing due dates for hard scheduled calendar landscape?&nbsp; In love with tags, and your seemingly endless desire to apply free form metadata to small snippets of text?</p>

<p>Then this is for you.&nbsp; I hereby present the most streamlined task entry form ever.&nbsp; Now with tags!</p>

<p>Through the magic of Outlook and customizable forms, I've hacked Outlook's default task entry form down to the bare essentials:&nbsp; the task, tags on the task, and its priority.&nbsp; I've saved this as my default form for the &quot;Tasks&quot; folder in Outlook, muscle-memorized CTRL+SHIFT-K, and voila: super fast and easy task entry.</p>

<p>One of the most underappreciated aspects of Outlook is its &quot;Categories&quot; feature, which has both an overdesigned popup with embedded checkboxes, and a free form text entry field.&nbsp; The free form one takes comma delimited words and turns them into individual categories.&nbsp; For my implementation I pumped up the font sizes, and sexed up the word &quot;Categories&quot; by renaming it &quot;Tags&quot; to give my Outlook install just a bit of Web 2.0 cred.&nbsp; (Next up, yellow fade!)</p>

<p>The task listing is pared back to these three fields, and set to automatically group by whatever I'm sorting on -- priority or &quot;tag&quot; -- and I can use Outlook's (lame for email, fine for everything else) search feature to limit my todo list on a particular word.&nbsp; (Who needs contexts, when I can limit my view to things with the tag &quot;waiting for&quot;?)</p>

<p>I'm not into writing &quot;how to's&quot; for fun, so I'm not going to even attempt to writeup how you can add this to your Outlook install, but if you want the .oft file, <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/files/task-form.zip">here it is</a>, provided on an as is basis, with no support, no guarantees, and a warning it may kill your kittens and erase all your data if you even look at it funny, etc. </p>

<p>Now, back to the task list.</p>
