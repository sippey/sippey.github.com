Via [Sociate](http://sociate.com/blog/archives/2005_12_01_archive.html#113570566521282244), an excellent post from Sean Savage proposing [a typology of human social networks](http://www.cheesebikini.com/208/archives/000978.html) (HSNs).  Forget the usual friendsterisms; instead he presents POVs on HSNs from machines, corporations and memes.  Context is indeed everything.
