And now for something completely different, Hershey announced yesterday that [they're buying](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/26/BUGM6DTAOM1.DTL) Berkeley-based [Scharffen Berger](http://www.scharffenberger.com/).Â  I'm anxiously awaiting the Berkeley City Council measure that will officially condemn the sale of the gourmet chocolatier to corporate shills that exploit children by selling them non-organic snacks laden with refined sugar and saturated fats.

I haven't been on the Scharffen Berger [tour](http://www.scharffenberger.com/tour_main.php), but I hear there may be a chocolate waterfall involved.
