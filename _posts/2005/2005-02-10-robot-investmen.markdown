Jason rightly [debunks](http://www.kottke.org/05/02/43-things-amazon-conspiracy) the [conspiracy theories](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/02/08/43/index_np.html) behind the [Amazon investment](http://robotcoop.com/weblog/51/word-on-investment) in the Robot Co-op.

> Perhaps Salon doesn't realize that the people posting their hopes and dreams to 43 Things are effectively whispering them to the whole world because -- if you'll forgive me channeling [Dooce](http://www.dooce.com/) here -- ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE ON [THEIR WEB SITE](http://www.43things.com/home/). Thousands of hopes and dreams, free for the taking.

(Oh, and congrats to Erik and team!Â  Here's to building great stuff.)
