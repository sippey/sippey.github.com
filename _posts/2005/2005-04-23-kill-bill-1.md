Finally got around to watching _Kill Bill_ (both volumes).  Why hadn't someone forced me to do that sooner?  The mix of kung fu and spaghetti western was pitch perfect; as were the soundtrack, the wire work, the time shifting, the mix of b/w and color. etc., etc.  Despite its length, Tarantino did a great job of not mucking up the revenge plot with too much backstory -- there was just enough to make the time-shifting worthwhile.  I probably could have done without the bleeping of The Bride's real name, but the other cute "I'm an auteur" tricks weren't nearly as annoying as they were in Pulp Fiction.  The anime sequence was brilliant, and the battle between Thurman and Liu in the snow was one of the more beautiful set pieces I've seen in a long time...
