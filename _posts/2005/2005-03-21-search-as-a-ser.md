This is probably obvious to most, but it just hit me in the face this morning:  desktop search is best executed both as an app ("I'm going here to find something") and as a component of the OS ("I need to attach a file to this message, now where is that again?").  Something as simple as baking search (and ideally fast preview) functionality into the File Open dialog would go a long way towards enabling ["search rather than browse](http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000687.html)" behavior.
