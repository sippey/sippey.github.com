Ruby on Rails [0.11](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/22/rails-0110-ajax-pagination-non-vhost-incoming-mail/) is out, and it includes [helper tags](http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavascriptHelper.html) for doing Ajax-style development.  (Plus, bulit in pagination support, inbound email handling, and _very_ importantly, "Rails applications no longer require their own virtual host to be easy to set up.")  They're starting to make building CRUD-heavy web apps ridiculously easy.
