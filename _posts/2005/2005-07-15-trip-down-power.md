Jason Levine posts a [great little photoset](http://flickr.com/photos/queso/sets/592302/) of the otherwise deadly boring act of migrating files off an old computer...except this time the old computer is a PowerBook Duo 230.  Has to be one of my all time favorite machines; I used one for a couple of years -- well after its prime -- and wrote my most _(um, only? --ed.)_ productive two years of Obvious pieces on it...  I recognize the ridiculousness of professing love for a hunk of plastic, metal and glass...but I _loved_ that machine.

(Oh, and I wanted to leave the nostalgia category alone with its sole [black holes](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/nostalgia/index.html) post, but I just couldn't file this one anywhere else, now could I.)
