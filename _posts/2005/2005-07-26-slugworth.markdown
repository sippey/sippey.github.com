<p>And now for something completely different, Hershey announced yesterday that <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/26/BUGM6DTAOM1.DTL">they're buying</a> Berkeley-based <a href="http://www.scharffenberger.com/">Scharffen Berger</a>.&nbsp; I'm anxiously awaiting the Berkeley City Council measure that will officially condemn the sale of the gourmet chocolatier to corporate shills that exploit children by selling them non-organic snacks laden with refined sugar and saturated fats.</p>

<p>I haven't been on the Scharffen Berger <a href="http://www.scharffenberger.com/tour_main.php">tour</a>, but I hear there may be a chocolate waterfall involved.</p>
