You know, I'd probably sign up for [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/subs/primeclub/signup/main.html) if it meant that any gifts that were sent to me off of [my wish list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/1OAC0X1PWJ0U2/) were afforded the same privileges (free two-day shipping or overnight shipping for only $3.99).
