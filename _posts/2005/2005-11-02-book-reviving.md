[Scott Berkun](http://www.scottberkun.com) tosses off something interesting in a [quick post](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=152) pointing to recent reviews of his (most excellent, highly recommended) book [_The Art of Project Management_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007868/statingtheobviou/):

> Most folks don’t know it but the window for books is small: if it’s not picked up in reviews soon after publication, odds are slim anyone will ever even hear about it.  My own interests aside, any time you write a blog post or amazon review for a book, it makes a huge difference to us authors.

This is "Long Tail 101," of course\[1\], but it's always great to hear it straight from the authors out on the tail, so support the ones you love!

\[1\]  What's the over/under on how long it will take until a top 20 MBA program offers a course in _The Economics of the Long Tail_?
