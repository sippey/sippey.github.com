Kottke [on Tumblelogs](http://www.kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs):  "older style weblogs that feel very much like these tumblelogs with minimal commentary, little cross-blog chatter, the barest whiff of a finished published work, almost pure editing...really just a way to quickly publish the "stuff" that you run across every day on the web."  I used to do a lot more of this (filtered for purity), and it's why sippey.com (and now sippey.typepad.com) started up in the first place; as to distinguish it from essays at Stating the Obvious.  Tools obviously influence content (a la Jason's point about MT and post titles), and I think a lot of the "tumblelogging" that used to happen in a blog context has now shifted to tools like delicious, where the workflow is streamlined for bookmarking, quick commenting, tagging and distributing. 

And regardless of the etymology, I like the _sound_ of "tumblelog," since it almost implies a katamari approach to content creation.  More on top of more on top of more on top of more...
