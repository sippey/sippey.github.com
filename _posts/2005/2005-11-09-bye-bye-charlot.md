Because I know you've been waiting patiently to find out if I threw [the book](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/11/i_am_getting_an.html) across the room...I did. Wolfe's silly attempts to capture the "fuck patois" of the college campus ("Look at me, I'm down with the lingo!") were exhausting, the ending was a cop out (everything too neat and tidy, the characters' fate decided by a third-rate, two-dimensional bit player), the last few pages a spastic attempt to project some sort of ill-fitting psychological profile on to Charlotte.

No more Wolfe for this reader.Â  Any suggestions for palate-cleansing novels?
