So some tidbits of news about Longhorn are making their way out of Microsoft.  Included in [Mary Jo Foley's writeup](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1838263,00.asp), amongst the (as yet unproven and untestable) claims of faster boot times, faster resume from suspend times and easier install was this little nugget...

Now _that's_ interesting.  I wouldn't put it past the [new and improved 'soft](http://channel9.msdn.com/) to enable enterprises to aggregate these annotations for wider use, or to allow users to opt-in to have their annotations shared back to the mother ship as a feedback mechanism.  The spam problem would be a bit problematic without either central or community-based editorial control, but one could imagine having the help system auto-subscribe to useful annotations from other Windows users that match your skill level.
