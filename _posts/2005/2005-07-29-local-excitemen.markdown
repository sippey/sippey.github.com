<p>So the big news in North Berkeley this week was the guy who drove his SUV through the front door of the Starbucks that's literally up the block from my house.&nbsp; Photo and excerpt swiped from the <a href="http://www.berkeleydaily.org/article.cfm?issue=07-29-05&amp;storyID=21955">Berkeley Daily Planet</a> story (emphasis mine)...</p><blockquote><p> An SUV driver battered his vehicle through the doors of the Starbucks at Solano and Colusa avenues Tuesday morning, scattering a dozen or more customers who leapt out of the way and jumped through open windows <strong>as he backed up and tried it again</strong>.&nbsp; “He appeared to be aiming for the counter,” said Berkeley Police spokesperson Officer Joe Okies.&nbsp; After the second try, the driver backed out and sped away northbound on Colusa Avenue, leaving parts of vehicle scattered inside and outside the coffee shop.</p></blockquote><p>Either the guy really hates coffee, or maybe he got the <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/07/slugworth.html">Scharffen Berger story</a> wrong?&nbsp; Whatever his motivation, thank God no one was hurt...</p>
