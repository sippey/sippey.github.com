If we're supposedly living in this glorious future of [personalized news](http://my.yahoo.com/) and [social search](http://myweb.yahoo.com/) delivered through [flashing desktop widgets](http://www.konfabulator.com) and [ambient devices](http://www.ambientdevices.com/), why don't I have lights flashing and bells whistling alerting me to the fact that it's 12:01 a.m, and there's no apparent BART settlement?  This is one piece of news that absolutely will have a tangible impact on my day (and demeanor) tomorrow...why don't I know about it now?

Whine, moan.

**Update:**  OK, so no BART strike.  That's a good thing.  I still want my jetpack, though.
