File this under "living vicariously," a piece of direct mail on very tasteful letterhead, sent from [165 Charles St](http://www.165charlesstreet.com/index_new.html).  Ignoring the fact that someone really screwed up the database pull on this one, it's worth blogging in its entirety for the pure jaw-dropping lack of irony in its salesmanship.

> Dear  ___________________,
> 
> We are pleased to report that Richard Meier's residential masterpiece, 165 Charles Street, is nearing completion with occupancy scheduled for early this summer.  The simple, elegant beauty of its shimmering glass silhouette can now be experienced firsthand.  A limited selection of 2 bedroom plus study and 3 bedroom homes remain priced from $5.150 million, as well as one spectacular 4897 square foot full floor residence with an 1160 square foot Great Room.  All enjoy breathtaking Hudson River and cityscape panoramas and benefit from the privileged Pure Richard Meier lifestyle, including 24-hour concierge, 50' infinity-edge lap pool, state-of-the-art fitness center and screening room.  Private wine cellars and storage are also available.
> 
> Enclosed please find a recent article featured in _The New York Times_ portraying not only Richard Meier's undivided attention to every exterior and interior detail, but also his love for this collection of private homes.  We invite you to make an appointment to come experience his masterpiece with a private tour of 165 Charles Street.

Just a few notes, because I can't resist...

*   If I'm parsing that second sentence correctly, does that mean that one can actually gaze upwards at the building's remarkable facade?  For _free_?
*   I'm surprised that they haven't trademarked the phrase "Pure Richard Meier Lifestyle."  How will they sell the rights to Target?
*   Private wine cellars.  Sweet.
*   What, they couldn't get the rights to the [Vanity Fair piece](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/main/archives/000456.html) on his towers?  Or ship a DVD copy of the Law & Order episode it turned into?

And in case you missed it, this building is a _masterpiece_.  Because they said so.  Twice.
