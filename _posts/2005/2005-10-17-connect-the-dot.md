Exhibit one:  Anil on [The Flip 2k5](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/10/17/the_flip_2k5), or "Yahoo bought everyone on my buddy list, and all I got was this t-shirt." \[1\]  Exhibit two:  nine years ago in Suck, [the pitch for wordprocessor.com](http://suck.com/pitch/96/10/15/).\[2\]  Connecting the dots is an exercise left to the reader.\[3\]

\[1\]  Note to self:  more charts, less talk.  
\[2\]  I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  it's wonderful to have [Suck re-runs](http://www.livejournal.com/users/suckcom/) show up in your LiveJournal friends page.  It's like it's coming from an old pal....  
\[3\]  Up with footnotes.
