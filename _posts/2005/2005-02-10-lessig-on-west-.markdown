I've been leading a fairly Boing Boing free existence for a while, so I missed the fact that [Larry Lessig was on last night's West Wing](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/09/lessig_portrayed_on_.html)...playing himself, played by   Christopher Lloyd.  (TiVo to the rescue!)  Someone (Haughey?) should get on the stick and build a "Where in the World is Larry Lessig" _(or, more appropriately, "actor representations of Larry Lessig")_ board game so that fans around the world can have their own fun figuring out what media vehicle will feature the blogosphere's favorite lawyer next...  (Updated 2/11/05)
