Now for [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/), an [Oblique Strategies](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/reference/oblique.html) widget, featuring the aphorisms from the micro-famous card deck by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt.  OK, design geeks:  the clock is ticking.  Just how long will it take for someone to convert Bruce Mau's [Incomplete Manifesto for Growth](http://www.brucemaudesign.com/manifesto.html) into an attractively beveled and opaque widget?  On second thought, forget Bruce Mau, how about a tastefully animated bright red slideshow of [Chairman Mao's quotations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotations_from_Chairman_Mao_Zedong)?  One of those oughta get the creative juices flowing when you hit a dry patch. _(Via the [43Folders mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/43Folders).)_
