<p>Seen scrawled outside the Journalism School on the campus of UC Berkeley this afternoon:</p>

<blockquote>Journalism students.  I have a good story, maybe a great story, a local government mini-Watergate.  You want it?  The first one to contact me get exclusive.  (the story ties to Atty. General Bill Lockyer) boatbrain@aol.com.  Oh, I have Lockyer's home number, too.  Might come in handy.</blockquote>

<p>The home number thing is a nice touch, don't you think?</p>
