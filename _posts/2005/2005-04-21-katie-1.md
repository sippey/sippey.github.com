Kudos to Rogers Cadenhead (a) for using his newly nabbed BenedictXVI.com to benefit [Modest Needs](http://www.modestneeds.org/), and (b) for the delightully arch "Katie?" at the end of his _Today_ show appearance. 

(I'm sure it will be linked all over, but here's the href anyway:  [Supporting Modest Needs](http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/entry/2005/04/21.html "Supporting Modest Needs").)
