James Hong, infamous creator of HOTorNOT (seen last night in the Daily Show's writer's credit skit), appears to have done it again:  [savemyass.com](http://www.savemyass.com/), "a personal assistant that keeps your girlfriend or wife happy by sending her flowers on your behalf, on a regular but semi-random basis." 

The inspired feature is the [Panic Button](http://savemyass.com/public/tour "scroll to the bottom of the page"), where you can indicate to the system just how bad your situation is...the screenshot shows "she's throwing things" as being pretty far to one end of the spectrum.
