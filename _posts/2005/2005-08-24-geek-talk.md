Not that we need even more proof that [Talk](http://talk.google.com/) (dot google dot com) is [built by geeks](http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html) (in a _good_ way, dammit), I came across this little feature.  Type something like this...

> hello, that's a \*very\* big world you have there.

...and it's rendered like this...

> hello, that's a **very** big world you have there.

Yep -- that's limited wiki markup, in your chat client!  It would be great if that feature were implemented like text filtering plugins are in MT; you could build custom markup for chat sessions to enable  formatting, keyword shortcuts, URL builders, etc.  Or, of course, a filter that automatically translates everything into [pig latin](http://www.google.com/intl/xx-piglatin/) for conducting not-terribly-secure conversations.
