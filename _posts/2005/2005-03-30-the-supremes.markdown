File under "the genius of editorial calendaring," but the timing of reading Margaret Talbot's _New Yorker_ profile of Justice Scalia on the train ride in this morning, and learning of the Supreme Court's ruling on [Title IX retaliation](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/politics/30scotus.html) ruling this afternoon couldn't have been any sweeter.
