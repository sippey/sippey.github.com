<p>(My God, how dreadful was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006IIPIK/statingtheobviou/"><em>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</em></a>?&nbsp; The look was &quot;nice,&quot; but it got in the way of the story, and the soundtrack was insufferable.&nbsp; Ever present, melodramatic -- it kept reminding me of why I can't stand watching Gone With the Wind -- the music just <em>won't stop</em>.&nbsp; And then there were power hungry robots living in Tibet, and then nothing but sleep.&nbsp; Blissful sleep.)</p>
