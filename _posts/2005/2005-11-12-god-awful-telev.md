Have to get this in under the wire, before the "one week to talk about the latest episode" elapses.  That "live debate" on The West Wing?  Possibly the worst 20 minutes of television I've ever seen.  The other 40 minutes were viewed in Tivo triple fast forward, just to see if anyone in the "audience" would shoot one of the candidates to put themselves out of their own misery.

What's the equivalent of "spinning in your grave" if you're alive?  Whatever it is, Aaron Sorkin's doing it.
