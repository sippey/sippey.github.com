When it comes to PowerPoint, I just can't leave [well enough alone](http://www.clicktoaddtitle.com/).  Here's a little ditty I whipped up to utterly shame [Matt and Merlin](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/03/since_u_been_co.html):  another PPT version of everyone's favorite earworm, constructed with the help of the AutoContent Wizard. 

>\> Download [since-youve-been-gone.pps](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/files/since-youve-been-gone.pps) (76k PowerPoint Show file).  Requires either PowerPoint or the PowerPoint viewer.
