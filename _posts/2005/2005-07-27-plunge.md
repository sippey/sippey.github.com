This one's for [Webb](http://www.interconnected.org/home/) and [Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org/), the motivating factors behind any recent visits to the Tonga Room:  [When Plunge was a Splash](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/07/26/SPGV5DTHH21.DTL), a piece in yesterday's SF Chronicle about the formerly famous diving pool that became the currently famous tiki bar...with a pool.  (And a floating island.  With a band on it.  That arrives and departs through actual indoor thunder showers.)
