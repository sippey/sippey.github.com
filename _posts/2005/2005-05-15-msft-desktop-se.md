Just noting that [Microsoft is shipping 1.0 of desktop search tomorrow](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+ups+ante+in+desktop+search/2100-1032_3-5706764.html?tag=nefd.top), and it will include results previewing.Â  I'm [still a fan of the tool](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/02/a_couple_of_mon.html); looking forward to 1.0.
