Sometimes, crowds aren't so wise.  Case in point, [tagyu.com](http://www.tagyu.com/), which is learning from what other people have written to make tag recommendations on user-supplied content.  It works if you're writing about things that geeks are writing about...but that's about it. 

Case in point. Input:  "On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree."  Output:  "php programming pear."  I'm not necessarily knocking the concept or the implementation -- other than to note that this will have limited utility until there's a broader corpus of tagged content.  And tags today are the realm of early adopters...like people who have a high likelihood of using the words "pear" and "php" near each other.  Will be interesting to track this over time...six months from now (and after a holiday tagging season), has the output for that pear-tree situated partridge changed?
