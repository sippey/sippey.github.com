Seen scrawled outside the Journalism School on the campus of UC Berkeley this afternoon:

> Journalism students. I have a good story, maybe a great story, a local government mini-Watergate. You want it? The first one to contact me get exclusive. (the story ties to Atty. General Bill Lockyer) boatbrain@aol.com. Oh, I have Lockyer's home number, too. Might come in handy.

The home number thing is a nice touch, don't you think?
