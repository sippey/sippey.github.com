Google Maps -- making [driving directions](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=berkeley%20ca%20to%20clayton%20mo&spn=23.937500%2C39.486495) actually _fun_. 

(Just wait until they enable an overlay of satellite imagery from [Keyhole](http://www.keyhole.com/) with one click.  Then someone will write a bookmarklet-y thing to transition from a zoomed-in Google map to an Amazon street-level photoset.  And then we'll never have to leave the house -- we'll just buy huge monitors and pretend we can fly around the country like Chris Reeves did in _Superman_.)
