OK, I'll get this one in under the wire too, before tonight's episode of the The Office.  I know there are plenty of purists out there who will claim that the NBC version will never be as funny as the original  from the BBC, but I beg to disagree.  Steve Carrell is pitch perfect as Michael, the ongoing storyline of the office romance is sweet without coming anywhere near treacle, and they're doing a great job of adapting for the US audience.

Case in point -- the show's obsession with Chili's.  Not only is it plot appropriate ("Inc. Magazine wrote that Chili's is the businessman's new golf course." "Really?"  "Well, not yet.  I'm writing a letter to the editor." _Excuse the extreme paraphrasing --ed._), but last week's episode had Carrell and Tim Meadows doing a brief duet of the "Baby Back Ribs" song.  Product placement doesn't get any better than that, folks.
