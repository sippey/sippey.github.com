I usually don't post little tips like this, but this one is just too simple, useful and undiscoverable to pass up.  Courtesy of the 43 Folders discussion list:  [subject line editing](http://groups.googlegroups.com/group/43Folders/msg/7c3b89e7df1d5e46) in Outlook:

> First, double click the e-mail (or hit enter) to open it in a separate window. Then put your cursor on the subject line and start typing. That's it. You can add your own reference - date, project number, whatever - or change the subject line completely. Whatever is going to be meaningful to you. Use as many words you like. When you're done, Ctrl+S to save.

Go nuts.
