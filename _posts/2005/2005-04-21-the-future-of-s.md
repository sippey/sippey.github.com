Kottke digests some interesting notes about Spotlight and the coming tools in OS X to denote relationships between two objects in the OS (_this_ invoice is related to _this_ PSD file).  Being a recovering [Brain](http://www.thebrain.com) user, I have to wonder just how Apple will handle the task of presenting those relationships.  And, assuming that they make those relationships discoverable, what kind of apps get built to browse that data.
