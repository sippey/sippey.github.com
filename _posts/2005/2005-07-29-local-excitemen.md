So the big news in North Berkeley this week was the guy who drove his SUV through the front door of the Starbucks that's literally up the block from my house.  Photo and excerpt swiped from the [Berkeley Daily Planet](http://www.berkeleydaily.org/article.cfm?issue=07-29-05&storyID=21955) story (emphasis mine)...

> An SUV driver battered his vehicle through the doors of the Starbucks at Solano and Colusa avenues Tuesday morning, scattering a dozen or more customers who leapt out of the way and jumped through open windows **as he backed up and tried it again**.  “He appeared to be aiming for the counter,” said Berkeley Police spokesperson Officer Joe Okies.  After the second try, the driver backed out and sped away northbound on Colusa Avenue, leaving parts of vehicle scattered inside and outside the coffee shop.

Either the guy really hates coffee, or maybe he got the [Scharffen Berger story](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/07/slugworth.html) wrong?  Whatever his motivation, thank God no one was hurt...
