So a friend mentioned in passing today that she's about to take a trip to L.A., and that one of her destinations is [The Museum of Jurassic Technology](http://www.mjt.org/).  (Which, if you've never been to, you need to visit.  Don't ask questions, just go.)  Since there was connectivity and a browser at hand, the conversation led to a quick visit to the MJT's website.  And that led, naturally, to their online museum shop, which is chock full of great products like [The Eye of the Needle View-Master Reel](http://store.yahoo.com/museumjt/eyeofnevire.html) and [The Cone of Obliscence Pedestal](http://store.yahoo.com/museumjt/pedestal.html).  (Ahhh, if only they resold such goods through Amazon, then I could add them to my wishlist.)

Fans of the museum will relish the fact that the "recommended books" section of the gift shop is naturally missing _[Mr. Wilson's Cabinet Of Wonder](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679764895/statingtheobvioua/)_ (subtitled "Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology," and should be read only _after_ a pilgrimage to Culver City).
