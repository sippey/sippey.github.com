I can't tell you how disappointed I am that a search for [_wifi "disco ball"_](http://www.google.com/search?biw=1024&hl=en&q=wifi+%22disco+ball%22&btnG=Google+Search) doesn't have anything from [boingboing.net](http://www.boingboing.net) in its first few pages of results.Â  You'd think that such a device (which would be a fantastic addition to any workspace) would be right up their alley.
