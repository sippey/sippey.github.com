[![Sky Captain!](https://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0006IIPIK.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_PB_PU_PU5_.jpg "Sky Captain!")](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006IIPIK/statingtheobviou/)I have a new rule.  If I can't stay awake during a movie, it's not worth watching twice.  Thank God for Netflix, I can just power through movies I won't watch twice.  

(My God, how dreadful was [_Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006IIPIK/statingtheobviou/)?  The look was "nice," but it got in the way of the story, and the soundtrack was insufferable.  Ever present, melodramatic -- it kept reminding me of why I can't stand watching Gone With the Wind -- the music just _won't stop_.  And then there were power hungry robots living in Tibet, and then nothing but sleep.  Blissful sleep.)
