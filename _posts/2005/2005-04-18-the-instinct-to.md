Courtesy of rodcorp.typepad.com, [an excerpt](http://rodcorp.typepad.com/rodcorp/2005/03/how_we_work_don.html) from the 1993 _Paris Review_ interview with Don DeLillo.  It's so nice to see this online (thanks, Bryan, for the pointer); I have a copy of the issue in a box somewhere.  This graf about his editing process has stuck with me for years...

> Discarded pages mark the physical dimensions of a writer's labor--you know, how many shots it took to get a certain paragraph right. Or the awesome accumulation, the gross tonnage, of first draft pages. ... I find I'm more ready to discard pages than I used to be. I used to look for things to keep. I used to find ways to save a paragraph of sentence, maybe by relocating it. Now I look for ways to discard things. If I discard a sentence I like, it's almost as satisfying as keeping a sentence I like. I don't think I've become ruthless or perverse--just a bit more willing to believe that nature will restore itself. **The instinct to discard is finally a kind of faith.** It tells me there's a better way to do this page even though the evidence is not accessible at the present time.

Emphasis mine.
