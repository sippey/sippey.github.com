For the GTD in Outlook folks (and you know who you are), there are [two](http://www.winsupersite.com/files/pdc2005-outlook12.wmv) [videos](http://www.winsupersite.com/files/pdc2005-outlook12b.wmv) up on Paul Thurrott's [SuperSite](http://www.winsupersite.com/) for Windows [from PDC 2005](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/pdc2005.asp) that are worth watching.  The first one shows off Outlook 12's new "to do bar," which is viewable when you're reading email, and the ability to right-click and automatically create a task from a message.  The second one shows off the integrated RSS reader, and the rebuilt search implementation.  (It's.  About. Time.)

Outlook 12 isn't getting the UI overhaul that the rest of the Office suite is (the changes in v11 were probably enough for most folks), but the simple "right click, make task" feature will be addition enough...
