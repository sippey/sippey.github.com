What a drag.  I was looking forward to all the local news coverage of the [aforementioned ski jump](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/08/ski_jumping_rio.html) on the Fillmore Street hill this weekend, but alas -- [it's been postponed](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/25/BAG9GECF4P32.DTL).  And pity Johnny Moseley, he'll need to find another way to celebrate his 30th.
