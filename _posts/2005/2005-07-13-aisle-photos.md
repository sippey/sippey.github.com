I really like Bryan Boyer's [Aisle of Averages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryan/sets/584137/)...

> Perspective shots of grocery store aisles are distorted back out of perspective so that the shelf forms a rectangle in the picture plane instead of trapezoid. Then four passes of motion blur @ 999 to arrive at a kind of loose average or wash of the shelf's chromatic contents.

...even though I'd rather imagine Bryan mounting his camera on a shopping cart, setting the exposure time to 10 seconds and then hurtling the cart down the aisle shouting "Fore!"
