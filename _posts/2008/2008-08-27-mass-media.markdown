<p>I'm fascinated by <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?sa=X">Google's Hot Trends</a>. I don't have a chance to follow it much during the day, but I keep it open in a tab when I'm online at home at night and occasionally refresh and it's amazing just how closely search traffic follows what's happening on TV.</p>

<p>News flash: people are watching the convention. And Dennis Rodman's going to be on this season's <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em>. Also, I had no idea what <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=slippery+kittens&amp;date=2008-8-27&amp;sa=X">slippery kittens</a> was, or why it would end up in the top 20 hot search terms for tonight, but a quick clickthrough led to the exciting news that they were on <em>America's Got Talent</em> tonight. Good for them! I guess.</p>
