<p>At Six Apart we're (usually) happy users of the <a href="http://www.freeconferencecall.com/">FreeConferenceCall.com</a> service.  And, like most dial-in services, they have this really catchy[1] tune they play while you wait for others to join your call.</p>

<p>God bless Anil Dash, who nabbed the song and remixed it to create this lovely track...</p>

</ul>

<p>As he blogged internally, "if you like being on hold with FreeConferenceCall.com, you'll love this song."</p>

<p>[1] Look, I find it catchy.  I understand that most don't.</p>
