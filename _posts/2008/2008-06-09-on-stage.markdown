Holy cow, what a blast.</p> 

<p>Huge kudos to Ray Marshall, who built the app and did a tremendous job running the demo; and also to Stephane Delbecque, who's our mobile product manager. I'm incredibly happy for the team -- amazing work! (Wanna come work with us? <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/jobs/">We're hiring!</a>)</p>

<p>And just how massive of an ego does it take to link to <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0806wdt546x/event/index.html">the keynote</a> and tell you to "fast forward to about the 30 minute mark"? I guess we're finding out right about now.</p>
