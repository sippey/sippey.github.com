Via [.tiff](http://tiffchow.typepad.com/tiff/2008/10/secret-fever---clifford-lidell.html) comes the latest mix(tape) from Clifford Lidell (formerly known as Casio), titled _Secret Fever_. I'm not anything close to being a connoisseur of mixes, and I'll admit to loving this one because there's a decent portion of [dad rock](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/42878-sky-blue-sky) embedded within, but I dare you **not** to love the segment about 16:40 in where he combines Wilco's _[Hell is Chrome](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2006/02/hell_is_chrome.html)_ with Chromeo's _Tenderoni_ (get it?) and D.I.M.'s _Is You._

So very very good. [Download](http://rapidshare.com/files/152540971/Secret_Fever.mp3.html) and enjoy it this weekend.
