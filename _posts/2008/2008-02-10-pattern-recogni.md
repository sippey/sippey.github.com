So I'm making my way through [The Black Swan](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400063515/statingtheobviou); highly recommended. IAONAN (I Am Obviously Not A Neuroscientist), but Taleb's argument that our brains just aren't wired for outliers seems to be the flip side (in a good way) of Jeff Hawkins' descriptions of conscious thought in [On Intelligence](http://www.onintelligence.org/). Our brains are constantly doing pattern recognition, looking for how things fit...and being (quite literally) surprised when they don't. (And "click" went my brain.)Â  Plus, I haven't come across more descriptive terms than "mediocristan" and "extremistan." Perfect.
