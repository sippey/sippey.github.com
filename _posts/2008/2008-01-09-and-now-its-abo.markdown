<p>More Wednesday coverage of what New Hampshire Tuesday means: <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=122977">Ad Age looks at the shift coming</a> in the campaign from on-the-ground flesh pressing organizations to a necessarily more media-driven campaign.  After all, there's no way in hell the candidates will be able to shake hands with every single likely voter in all of the Super Duper Tuesday states.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"They'll be looking at tactical media strikes in select markets vs. a national effort," [Democratic Media Consultant Steve McMahon] said, predicting that national cable and some network TV news and public-affairs programming could be the beneficiary of any national buys. </p>

<p>It's even more interesting for the Republicans than the Democrats, according to Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, especially if there's no clear front-runner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Feb. 5 is potentially going to be a problem for most of the Republican candidates," he said. "Unless Romney wants to take all his [personal wealth], competing in all 20 states is going to be prohibitively expensive. They don't have $40 million to $50 million in the bank, so what you are going to see is a very different process and a different kind of ad strategy where they are going to do national cable and look for other places to target."</p>
