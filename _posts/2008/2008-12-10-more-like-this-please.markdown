<p>Dear internets: please produce more seven second videos like this.</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FquWyoT13ZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/FquWyoT13ZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></object>

</p><p>No, really. Think of all the planning and foresight that went into those seven seconds of goodness. The kids had to swipe the video camera, find two empty garbage cans and a length of plywood, convince one of their friends to lay prone on the plywood, climb the roof and <em>jump</em>. Oh, and then clean it all up in post with a perfectly ambiguous "is he OK?" shot at the end.</p>
