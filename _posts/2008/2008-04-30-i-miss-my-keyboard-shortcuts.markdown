<p>There's very little motivation for Microsoft to do this, but oh how much would I love to have all the keyboard shortcuts for menu and dialog navigation be available in Excel 2008 for the Mac that were available in Office for Windows?  Being forced to mouse around in Excel to do simple things like insert a row is absolutely infuriating, when in pre-switch times it would be a split second alt-I-R away. Not having these available is turning my trust swiss army knife of business computing into a dull, oversized butter knife.</p>

<p>(Oh, and have I told you lately that when I start a band it will be called Alabaster Whine?  Wanna join?  I'm looking for a bass player.)</p>
