Saw these Polaroids posted outside a local coffee shop this afternoon, and lamented the fact that I can't buy a simple Polaroid printer that takes my digital photos and prints perfect (or near-perfect) replicas of Polaroid snapshots. So my [happy-go-lucky coffee partner](http://twitter.com/mike_FTW/) pointed out that Polaroid just released the [PoGo printer](http://www.polaroid.com/pogo/us/) which is precisely **not** what I was thinking about.
