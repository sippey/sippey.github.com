For years I've been carrying around (and pitching anyone who would listen) this idea for a summer camp / reality show called "Inward Bound" where you take rich kids from the burbs and drop them in the middle of an unfamiliar city with only $1.69 and a good luck wish.

Obviously my idea never made it off the ground...which is probably for the best. But! MTV's gone and one upped it with their new series [Exiled](http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/exiled/series.jhtml), which takes former stars of their must-stop-watching-but-can't series _My Super Sweet 16_ and air drops them into radically unfamiliar territory...

> A few years after tossing the parties that made them stars in their schools and fueled rivalries among the rich kids, you're going to see some of the Sweet 16-ers you loved to hate the most -- Ava, Sierra, Amanda, Bjorn, Marissa, Chelsi, Meleny and Alex -- shipped away from their plush homes and easy lives and Exiled to foreign locations such as the jungles of the Amazon, the tundra of the Arctic Circle, the Andes mountains and remote islands in the South Pacific where they'll have to live like local commoners with none of the amenities of their normally privileged lives.

I don't even have to watch the show and I already love it: it's revenge of the TV viewer. I mean, we watched her preen and bitch and squeal and drive away in the brand new suckerparent-supplied BMW, and now we get to see Chelsi-with-an-I sent off to the Arctic Circle! Must see TV!
