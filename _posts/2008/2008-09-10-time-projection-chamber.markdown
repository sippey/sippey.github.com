<p>National Geographic has a <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/god-particle/ginter-photography.html">nice collection of photos of the LHC at CERN</a>, including this one of Peter Glaessel, a technical coordinator sitting inside the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber">time projection chamber</a>."</p>

<p>In other news, JJ Abrams debuted his new TV series <em><a href="http://www.fox.com/fringe/">Fringe</a></em> last night, which based on the pilot promises a full season of not-even-pseudoscience, completely improbable situations, ridiculous conspiracy theories and awkward love interests.  I'm personally hoping for a Large Hadron Collider guest appearance coupled with a time travel / black hole plotline somewhere around episode 8.  Talk about product placement opportunities...</p>
