[It was about time](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/media/11cartoons.html).

> Strawberry Shortcake was having an identity crisis. The "it" doll and cartoon star of the 1980s was just not connecting with modern girls. Too candy-obsessed. Too ditzy. Too fond of wearing bloomers. So her owner, American Greetings Properties, worked for a year on what it calls a “fruit-forward” makeover. Strawberry Shortcake, part of a line of scented dolls, now prefers fresh fruit to gumdrops, appears to wear just a dab of lipstick (but no rouge), and spends her time chatting on a cellphone instead of brushing her calico cat, Custard.

In other words... "The [Princesses](http://disney.go.com/princess/html/main_iframe.html) have been kicking us in the ass while those God awful [Bratz](http://www.bratz.com/) girls have been kicking us upside the head, so people we have to do _something_... I know, let's give her a cellphone! That'll make it all better."
