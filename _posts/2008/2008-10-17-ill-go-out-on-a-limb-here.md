Stating the obvious: [W](http://www.wthemovie.com/)'s gonna bomb. Oliver Stone jumped the shark with _Born on the Fourth of July_; people on the right will hate it without seeing it; and even the rabidly liberal probably don't want to spend their Saturday night reliving the present in a dark room, even if it is Josh Brolin. Best line from the [Times review](http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/movies/17ston.html?8dpc), on Brolin's performance: "Good as he is, he canâ€™t touch the original."

**Update:** I love this line from [Dave Winer's review](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/10/18/aVeryShortReviewOfW.html): "Well, it was a nice movie, but I never really got into the plot. It could be I know too much about the actual story, like having read the book before seeing the movie."
