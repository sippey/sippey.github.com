I think the [Seinfeld + Gates long form ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBWPf1BWtkw) was a lure to get us warmed up for these new "I'm a PC" spots. Which I think are great. Leaving aside operating system and brand preference for a minute, what's works with these ads is the message of joy and abundance and widespread use of **P**ersonal **C**omputing.

I use a Mac these days, but I'm also a PC. And I wear glasses.
