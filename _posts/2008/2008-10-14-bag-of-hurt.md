Quote of the day comes from Steve Jobs, in the post event Q&A. When asked why the (delicious) new laptops don't support BluRay, Jobs replied with this bon mot, according to [MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/136009/2008/10/liveupdate.html?lsrc=top_1?lsrc=top_1)...

> "**BluRay is a bag of hurt**," Jobs says. "The licensing of the technology is so complex that weâ€™re just waiting until things settle down and waiting until BluRay really takes off in the marketplace before we burden our customers with the cost of the licensing and the drives."

Oh, and seriously, those laptops look delicious, don't they?
