Just because, an entirely selfish list of five AppleiPhone-related things I'd love to see come out of Macworld this week. Not being a shareholder (_you idiot --ed._), these matter to me more than some 0.3" thick flash-RAM based tablet multitouch Macbook bundled with free EVDO for life as long as you consume all your media through iTunes.

*   Bluetooth syncing for calendar and contacts. Somewhere in a drawer at home I have an old Nokia that will iSync to iCal and Address Book; why is it that I have to plug my iPhone in to get my latest calendar updates in my pocket?
*   Landscape view for mail. Not to read more effectively, but to type more effectively. It's just more comfortable typing in landscape mode.
*   Haptics feedback for typing. Speaking of typing, I'd love a little, tiny piece of vibrate action when I type. The typing sound is annoying (to me and others), but I need a bit of feedback to make typing feel a bit more...real.
*   Navizon. They'll have to add this, right? Isn't this already available on a bunch of other devices with Google Maps apps?
*   A Kindle app for the iPhone. I did order a Kindle, but they're hopelessly backordered to the point where Amazon customer support can't won't tell me even what _month_ it's targeted for. In the meantime, if Kindle really is a "service" and not a device, how about an app for supporting that service on the iPhone?

Hey, three of the five meet the "something in the air" criteria, don't they?
