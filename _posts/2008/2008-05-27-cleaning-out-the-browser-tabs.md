It's about time I blog about all the open tabs in my browser, just so I can clear my head and get on with my life.

*   They're making a movie version of _The Road_. Nuclear apocalypse! Cannibalism! With a [charming young child actor](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/05/the_road_to_star_worlds_only.html)!

OK, that was the only open tab...and blogging it isn't making me feel any better. After all, I doubt that even Viggo Mortensen can play it bleak enough to do justice to this line:

> When your dreams are of some world that never was or of some world that never will be and you are happy again than you will have given up. Do you understand? And you can't give up. I won't let you.

Hooray for Hollywood!
