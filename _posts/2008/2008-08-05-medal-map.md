Great piece of info porn from the New York Times, an [interactive medal map](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html) that shows the distribution of Olympic medal winnings by country over time. What I love is that you scrub the slider from 1894 to the present is just how much more diverse the winnings are -- more countries competing, more countries winning.

[![Medal-count](https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef00e553cf7f418833-800wi "Medal-count")](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html)

And if you scrub the slider fast enough you can quickly skip over the whole 1980 thing.
