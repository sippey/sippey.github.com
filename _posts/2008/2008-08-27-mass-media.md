[![Google-trends-2](https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef00e5548544808833-500wi)](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?sa=X)

I'm fascinated by [Google's Hot Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?sa=X). I don't have a chance to follow it much during the day, but I keep it open in a tab when I'm online at home at night and occasionally refresh and it's amazing just how closely search traffic follows what's happening on TV.

News flash: people are watching the convention. And Dennis Rodman's going to be on this season's _Celebrity Apprentice_. Also, I had no idea what [slippery kittens](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=slippery+kittens&date=2008-8-27&sa=X) was, or why it would end up in the top 20 hot search terms for tonight, but a quick clickthrough led to the exciting news that they were on _America's Got Talent_ tonight. Good for them! I guess.
