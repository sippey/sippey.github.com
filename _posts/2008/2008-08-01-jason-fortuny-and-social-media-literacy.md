Somewhere in me I have a thousand word post on the need for social media literacy education in lower education\[1\]...but for today I'll just quote Jason Fortuny in the everywhere-linked [New York Times piece on Internet trolls](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?hp=&pagewanted=all).

> "You seem to know exactly how much you can get away with, and you troll right up to that line," I said. "Is there anything that can be done on the Internet that shouldn’t be done?"
> 
> Fortuny was silent. In four days of conversation, this was the first time he did not have an answer ready.

> "I don’t know," he said. "I have to think about it."

What's the old standby? There's a fine line between clever and stupid?

\[1\] In short, "media literacy" was focused on creating smarter media _consumers_; understanding how media's produced and distributed, the biases behind it, etc. (See also deconstructionism, etc.) "Social media literacy," on the other hand, needs to be focused on creating smarter media _producers_, who understand the ramifications of a hyper-connected zero-cost-of-distribution world. (See also Star Wars kid.)
