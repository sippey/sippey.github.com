File under "blogging this to remember it now" since Tim O'Reilly's already spread the meme far and wide [via Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/08/a-graphic-designer-puts-print.html). Fourteen design students with Frank Philippin and James Goggin produced [Dear Lulu](http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/005154.html), a digital book designed to test the capabilities of on-demand digital printers.

> My plan for the workshop is to investigate the visible and tangible parameters of graphic design — type specimens, halftone screens and, in particular, colour tests and calibration charts — and make a book of our own self-produced tests which we will send to print on Friday afternoon using the online print-on-demand system Lulu. The book project will therefore act as a colour/type/pattern test of the very system with which it is produced.

Worth exploring since [Trina's](http://www.traywick.com/) considering some book projects for the artists she works with...

**Update:**

OK, maybe not. John [comments](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/08/dear-lulu.html#comment-127744066) that "I tested printing my infodesign book there and Lulu's quality was just terrible. I can't imagine using them for an art book." And via Google Reader, Bryan Boyer shared this comment on the Waxy link...

In case you can't read that _(hi, googlebot!)_ here's what he said:

> Nice idea, but apparently Lulu uses a network of print shops across the country to fulfill their printing needs, so I'd be hesitant to put much faith in the reproductions being consistent across all their equipment.
