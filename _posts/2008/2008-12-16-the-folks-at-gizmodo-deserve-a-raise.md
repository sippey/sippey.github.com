Gizmodo covers the [speculation on an Apple netbook for Macworld](http://gizmodo.com/5111464/analyst-hot-for-apple-netbook-at-macworld); but I’m fairly certain that the post was an excuse to publish the best artist’s rendition of an unreleased Apple product _evar_. It’s so good I won’t swipe it for myself — they deserve all the page views they can get for this one so click, dammit. Click.
