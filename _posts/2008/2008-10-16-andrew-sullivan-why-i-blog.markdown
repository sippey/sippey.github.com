<p>Andrew Sullivan's long form piece <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200811/andrew-sullivan-why-i-blog">Why I Blog</a>, posted today at theatlantic.com, gave me goose bumps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A blog, therefore, bobs on the surface of the ocean but has its anchorage in waters deeper than those print media is technologically able to exploit. It disempowers the writer to that extent, of course. The blogger can get away with less and afford fewer pretensions of authority. He is—more than any writer of the past—a node among other nodes, connected but unfinished without the links and the comments and the track-backs that make the blogosphere, at its best, a conversation, rather than a production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably the best long form piece on blogging I've ever read.</p>
