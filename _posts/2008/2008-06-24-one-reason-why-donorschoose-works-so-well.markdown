This message came from a project I helped fund with a small donation to bring art tables to a classroom in Northern California. It's a simple, straightforward way to help connect the dots between the gift and the kids it impacts.<br /><br />It's summertime, and teachers are getting ready for next year's classes -- why not <a href="http://donorschoose.org/">find a project to fund</a>?</p></p>
