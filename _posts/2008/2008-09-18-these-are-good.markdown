<p>I think the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBWPf1BWtkw">Seinfeld + Gates long form ad</a> was a lure to get us warmed up for these new "I'm a PC" spots.  Which I think are great.  Leaving aside operating system and brand preference for a minute, what's works with these ads is the message of joy and abundance and widespread use of <strong>P</strong>ersonal <strong>C</strong>omputing.</p>

<p>I use a Mac these days, but I'm also a PC.  And I wear glasses.</p>
