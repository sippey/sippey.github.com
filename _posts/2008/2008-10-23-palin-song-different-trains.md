Via Alex Ross at [The Rest is Noise](http://www.therestisnoise.com/2008/10/political-music.html) comes _Palin Song_, Henry Hey's piano accompaniment to Sarah Palin's interview with Katie Couric. Just press play and give it a minute to sink in...

As Ross points out, listeners who appreciate _Palin Song_ may also appreciate Steve Reich's _[Different Trains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Different_Trains)_. (If, like me, you're too lazy to click through to anything, here's a relevant snippet from Wikipedia: "In _Different Trains_, after each melody in the piece is introduced...a recording of the spoken phrase from which the melody derives is played.")
