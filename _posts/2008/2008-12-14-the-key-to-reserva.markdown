<p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt1151319/">The Key to Reserva</a> is a short film produced as an ad for Freixenet Cava, directed by Martin Scorsese and written by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0341372/">Ted Griffin</a>. In it Scorsese produces and directs the only three surviving pages of a &#8220;long-lost&#8221; Hitchcock screenplay.</p>

<p>The whole thing&#8217;s a joke, of course (an elaborate, beautiful, wonderful, well-produced joke), but I love the scene at the beginning between Scorsese and Griffin, where they&#8217;re discussing how Scorsese will shoot the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scorsese:  It has to be the way he would make the picture then, only making it now.  If he was alive now making it now he would make it now as if he made it back then.</p>
  
  <p>Griffin:  I understand perfectly.</p>
