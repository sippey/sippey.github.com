The water needs to be shaded because when sunlight mixes with the bromide and chlorine in Ivanhoe's water, the carcinogen bromate forms, said Pankaj Parekh, DWP's director for water quality compliance. Bromide is naturally present in groundwater and chlorine is used to kill bacteria, he said, but sunlight is the final ingredient in the potentially harmful mix."<br /><br />(Photo from Flickr, story from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-balls10-2008jun10,0,2142897.story?track=rss">LA Times</a>)</p></p>
