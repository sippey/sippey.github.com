Bill Clinton on Saturday in North Carolina:

> "Jesse Jackson won in South Carolina twice, in '84 and '88, and he ran a good campaign. And Senator Obama is running a good campaign."

Jesse Jackson, reached by phone in India by the [New York Times](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/jackson-not-upset-by-clinton-remarks/index.html?hp):

> "I don't read anything negative into Mr. Clinton's observation."
