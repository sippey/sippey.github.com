How great would it be to play with the [Skittle-based beat sequencer](http://www.vimeo.com/625464?pg=embed&sec=625464) with the kids? How better to teach them about the near infinite glories of what you can do with sixteenth notes and 4/4 time than with a bunch of colorful candies. Make a beat, eat the beat. Yum. (Via [Waxy](http://waxy.org/links/), of course.)

(But you know, come to think of it, a simple sequencer like this would be a great iPhone app, even if you can't eat the Skittles after making your beat. Instead, you could share them online. iPhone as drum machine. See, I knew I had to have an iPhone 2.0 reference today somewhere...)
