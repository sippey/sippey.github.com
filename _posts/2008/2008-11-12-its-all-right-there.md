David Byrne's [long and thoughtful post](http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2008/11/11908-philadelphia.html) on his visit to Philadelphia, the [Quilts of Gee's Bend](http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/) and the work of [James Castle](http://www.jcrist.com/jamescastle/) is worth reading.

> Now, one of the qualities that is often brought up to separate Castle or the Gee’s bend artists from those who more regularly show in fine art galleries, auction houses and museums is intention. It is assumed that there is an awareness and intention in a work by Warhol, Ruscha, Betcher, Polke, whomever, that is not there in someone like Castle. I would suggest that his work proves that this is just not true. His intentions may not be geared towards the same marketplace, collectors and trade publications, but aesthetically it’s all there. The response to the world, a way of looking, a seriousness, and an investigation of phenomena, thoroughly done and from multiple angles — it’s all right there.
