So yeah, it's raining here. **Really** raining. And blowing -- this morning on the Bay Bridge water was shooting _up_ from the grates that connect the sections of roadway, thanks to the wind tunnel on the lower deck. Never seen that before.

SFGate's [reporting](http://www.sfgate.com/flat/archive/2008/01/04/chronicle/archive/2008/01/04/MN87U9H6F.html) half a million homes without power, a bunch of highway, bridge and tunnel closures, BART shutdowns, and, of course, this gem: **"The San Francisco Zoo is closed because of downed trees that pose a potential escape risk with animals."**
