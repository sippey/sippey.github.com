Tyler Green continues to do [the best blogging](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/12/making_sense_of_a_total_mess_o.html) on the MOCA mess.

> Just in case it needs be said again, the MOCA trustees are proving that they’re the worst art museum board in America. … The idiocy of this cannot be overstated: The MOCA board is apparently more willing to inflict upon itself an embarrassing public failure than it is to admit it needs help. Is there a 12-step program for non-profit mismanagement?

Question: if MOCA was to go through a [12 step program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program), who would be their higher power? Eli Broad? Michael Govan from LACMA? James Wood from the Getty?

**Update:** Looks like it wouldn't be Wood, since the [Getty endowment is down 25 percent](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/12/getty_endowment_down_25_percen.html) since June...
