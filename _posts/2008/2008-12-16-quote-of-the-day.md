**“We’re on track for a terrific show this year,”** said Paul Kent, IDG’s general manager for Macworld, [when asked to comment](http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/12/16/steve-jobs-wont-give-macworld-keynote/) on the news that Steve Jobs won’t be keynoting January’s event and that Apple will be pulling out of the event after 2009.

Perhaps he meant the [archaic definition of terrific](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terrific)?
