Just finished [_Beautiful Children_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400066506/statingtheobvioua). Though there are stretches of great prose, I couldn't find my way into any sort of a plot arc, other than what Ponyboy wants to do to Cheri, and the slow and obvious disintegration of Lorraine. I didn't believe any of the characters...only its setting; the book itself is a lot like Las Vegas -- well marketed, seems like it'd be a lot of fun, pretty on the surface and leaves you feeling empty.
