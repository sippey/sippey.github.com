NPR's Morning Edition [interviewed Beck](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93769638) this morning about _[Modern Guilt](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Guilt-Beck/dp/B0019GAOI2)_, and, of course, his relationship with his grandfather, [Fluxus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus) member [Al Hansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hansen). I love this image of Hansen sending his grandkids to scour restaurants for cigarette butts out of ashtrays:

> "He liked to say he was an alchemist," Beck says. "But really, it was that he was broke. He couldn't afford art materials. So I think he decided early on, 'I'm going to make art out of what I have around,' which was candy wrappers and cigarette butts. When I was a child, he used to send us to the garbage can. When we were at a restaurant, we'd go to all the ashtrays that were left â€” we used to collect all the cigarette butts for him for his artwork."

Now _that's_ grandparenting.
