Business Week's Jessie Scanlon [covers](http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2008/id20080118_434274.htm) [The Designers Accord](http://www.designersaccord.org/), "a call to arms for designers to engage in the environmental movement with optimism and creativity." The core of The Designers Accord is a set of principles around bringing sustainability principles and practices to the product design process. From Scanlon's piece:

> For clients this is significant because it means that sustainability is going to be part of the conversation regardless of what studio they're talking to. Core77's Chochinov draws a comparison to LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design), the rating system introduced by the U.S. Green Building Council in 2000. "Today, you can't have a conversation with an architect without the question of LEED coming up," he says.

LEED obviously has a head start, with its well-defined set of ratings and processes for project certification and professional accreditation. It will be interesting to follow Designers Accord to see if there is a similar path to follow w/r/t product and packaging design...
