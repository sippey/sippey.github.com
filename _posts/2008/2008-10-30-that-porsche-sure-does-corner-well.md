Floyd Norris [explains Porsche's corner strategy](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/business/worldbusiness/31norris.html) on Volkswagen this week, which will likely end up netting them billions of euros. "If this works, Porsche will have made billions from a car company at a time when cars are not selling very well. ... If it comes to a question of whether regulators step in, Porsche has the advantage of facing off against short-selling hedge funds. There may not be a less popular group of investors, and their losses would provoke little sympathy."

And yes, the post title is deliberately bad.
