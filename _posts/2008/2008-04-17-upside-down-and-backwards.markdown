<p>A hallway at the San Francisco Tennis Club has a bunch of early photographs of San Francisco, including this one (snapped with my iPhone; apologies for the perspective and quality) of the west side of The Embarcadero in 1913.</p>

<p><img  alt="Owl" title="Owl" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef00e551dcb3ef8833-pi" border="0"></p>

<p>What I love about this photo (and it's probably hard to see here) is the billboard for Owl Cigars, with the reversed mirror image type. When you quickly walk by <em>the photo of the billboard</em> you do a double take, and I spent a few minutes confirming that this wasn't some weird artifact of the photo itself. (The photo didn't appear to be doctored at all.) The effect of this as a massive billboard must have been something. I'm no student of outdoor advertising, but while I can definitely remember plenty of instances of seeing trompe-l'oeil effects in billboards, I don't think I've seen something as "simply stunning" in a long time.</p>

<p>My colleague Sean Williford pointed out that <a href="http://www.standardhotels.com/">The Standard Hotels</a> does something related with their logo, turning their simple typeface upside down.</p>

<p>I love both of these -- simple twists that force the casual observer to stop, spend a bit more time processing what they're seeing and become memorable <em>because</em> of their simplicity. That said, if everyone started flipping their type around, everyday life would be more than a bit annoying.</p>

<p>Who else has done this kind of thing well?</p>
