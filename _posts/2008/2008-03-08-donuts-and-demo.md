I wasn't getting what I wanted out of the MSM coverage of the Wyoming caucuses today -- it was too much about the delegate count, not enough about the voters. Flickr to the rescue; [kdriese](http://flickr.com/photos/kdriese/) has a nice stream of shots of the caucus in Laramie. I love this shot...nothing says democracy like that telltale pink box of goodness.
