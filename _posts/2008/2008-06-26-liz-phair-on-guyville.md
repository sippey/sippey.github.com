Liz Phair's made a new documentary about her 1993 landmark "Exile in Guyville," timed with a reissue of the album. New York Mag's Vulture has a [great interview with her](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/06/liz_phair_on_going_back_to_guy.html), and as the father of two daughters whom I'm doing my best to raise as strong, vocal and opinionated young girls (and me arguably being one of those "guys") I absolutely loved this particular bit...Â 

> **It was interesting to learn from the documentary that you were pretty surrounded by guys on the making of Exile.**  
> I really was in Guyville. When I went back to the documentary, the one unifying thing with the guys is, they all talk a really long time, and then I get a tiny little word in edgewise. They were all like, "This is what's good," "This is what you should like," and I was like, \[sing-songy\] "fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you."

The documentary's bundled with the CD version of the reissue -- you can [pick it up at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Exile-Guyville-Liz-Phair/dp/B00197KG4S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1214344854&sr=1-1) and other fine retailers, I assume.
