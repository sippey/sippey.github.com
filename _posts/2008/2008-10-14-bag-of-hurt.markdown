When asked why the (delicious) new laptops don't support BluRay, Jobs replied with this bon mot, according to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/136009/2008/10/liveupdate.html?lsrc=top_1?lsrc=top_1">MacWorld</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<strong>BluRay is a bag of hurt</strong>," Jobs says. "The licensing of the technology is so complex that weâ€™re just waiting until things settle down and waiting until BluRay really takes off in the marketplace before we burden our customers with the cost of the licensing and the drives."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and seriously, those laptops look delicious, don't they?</p>
