<p>I went looking for a bit of Rauschenberg on YouTube this morning, and came across this quick <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCWh3IFtDQ">four and a half minute piece</a> on one of my favorites of his, the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue8/erasuregenteel.htm">Erased de Kooning Drawing</a>, from 1953.</p>

<p>I love this bit, about a minute and a half in...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I kept making drawings myself and erasing them.  And that just looked like an erased Rauschenberg.  You know, it was nothing.  So I figured out that it had to begin as art.  So it was going to be a De Kooning.  It was going to be an 'important' piece. You see how ridculously you have to think, in order to make this work?"</p>

<p>Michael Kimmelman's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/arts/design/14rauschenberg.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">obit in the New York Times</a> also captures this great Rauschenberg quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I really feel sorry for people who think things like soap dishes or mirrors or Coke bottles are ugly," he once said, "because theyâ€™re surrounded by things like that all day long, and it must make them miserable."</p>
