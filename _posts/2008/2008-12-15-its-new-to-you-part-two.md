I think I’ve discovered a microtrend: reviews of things that aren’t new. There’s reviewing things [everyone else has read but you haven’t](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/its-new-to-you.html), or there’s reviewing things you’ve already read…and maybe some of your readers haven’t. Example: Cynthia Crossen [reviews](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122929236542205063.html) John le Carré’s 1986 _A Perfect Spy_ in today’s Wall Street Journal.

> Generally, I don’t reread because so often the books disappoint me, and I feel as if I’ve lost an old friend. With the element of surprise gone, most books seem less powerful to me on a second read. It’s as though I’ve developed scar tissue.

You can buy the paperback edition of A Perfect Spy for a shade under $11, or if you have a le Carré fan on your Christmas list, a [first edition first printing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2F0743457927%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Ddp%255Folp%255Fcollectible%26condition%3Dcollectible&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) for just under $33.
