<p>Quickest way to distract yourself from the nervousness of watching election results is to just marvel in all the data visualization bits that all the news sites are breaking out.</p>

<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010535d9af5b970c-pi"><img class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010535d9af5b970c" alt="Big-board" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef010535d9af5b970c-320wi"  /></a></p>

<p>My favorite <em>right now</em> is the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/votes.html">Times' big board</a>.  Their map is nice, too, but I'm enjoying the state categorization and the ability to switch between different news organizations to see where their predictions stand...</p>
