Via [swissmiss](http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2008/11/the-future-of-m.html) comes [The Future of MUJI](http://www.muji.com/message/).

> MUJI is not a brand. MUJI does not make products of individuality or fashion, nor does MUJI reflect the popularity of its name in its prices. MUJI creates products with a view toward global consumption of the future. This means that we do not create products that lure customers into believing that "this is best" or "I must have this." We would like our customers to feel the rational sense of satisfaction that comes not with "This is best," but with "this is enough.". "Best" becomes "enough".

MUJI is opening stores in the US, most notably (IMHO) the MUJI to Go store at JFK International Airport.
