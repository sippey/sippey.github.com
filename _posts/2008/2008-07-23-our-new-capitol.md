I'm just getting around to looking through the photos from Bryan Boyer's masters thesis project for his degree in architecture, collected in the Flickr photo set [Our New Capitol](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryan/sets/72157605110935428/). The level of detail and thought into the entire design system that he's created is just astounding. Highly recommended.
