Via [43Folders](http://www.43folders.com/2008/05/07/43f-links-may-7th) _(Merlin, glad to see you back stringing together more than [140 characters](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) at a time!)_, this little snippet in a [NYTimes piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/business/04unbox.html) from M.J. Ryan on the benefits of practicing [kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)...

> Whenever we initiate change, even a positive one, we activate fear in our emotional brain. ... If the fear is big enough, the fight-or-flight response will go off and we’ll run from what we’re trying to do. The small steps in kaizen don’t set off fight or flight, but rather keep us in the thinking brain, where we have access to our creativity and playfulness.

Usually when I quote things like this I say "go read the rest." But this time, not so much. That's basically the best graf in the piece. (Look, I've just saved you time! Now go outside and enjoy the sunshine for a few minutes.)
