<p>Great piece of info porn from the New York Times, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html">interactive medal map</a> that shows the distribution of Olympic medal winnings by country over time. What I love is that you scrub the slider from 1894 to the present is just how much more diverse the winnings are -- more countries competing, more countries winning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef00e553cf7f418833" alt="Medal-count" title="Medal-count" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef00e553cf7f418833-800wi" border="2"></a></p>

<p>And if you scrub the slider fast enough you can quickly skip over the whole 1980 thing.</p>
