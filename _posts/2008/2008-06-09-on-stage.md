Holy cow, what a blast.

Huge kudos to Ray Marshall, who built the app and did a tremendous job running the demo; and also to Stephane Delbecque, who's our mobile product manager. I'm incredibly happy for the team -- amazing work! (Wanna come work with us? [We're hiring!](http://www.sixapart.com/jobs/))

And just how massive of an ego does it take to link to [the keynote](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0806wdt546x/event/index.html) and tell you to "fast forward to about the 30 minute mark"? I guess we're finding out right about now.

(Many thanks to Megan Frost of [Cute Overload](http://cuteoverload.com/) who snapped this pic from the second row!)
