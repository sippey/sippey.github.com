<p>Moving on from the runaway children of <em>Beautiful Children</em> (deep cleansing breaths, wash hands well with scalding hot water, hug kids one extra time before bed) to the three roving packs of werewolves in Toby Barlow's new novel-in-verse <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Teeth-Toby-Barlow/dp/0061430226/statingtheobvioua">Sharp Teeth</a></em>. I seem to have missed the cultural pivot point when books began to have full blown <a href="http://sharpteeththebook.com/">flash-intro websites</a> with viral video, but check out this little ditty, which will help you determine once and for all if your dog is a werewolf.</p>
