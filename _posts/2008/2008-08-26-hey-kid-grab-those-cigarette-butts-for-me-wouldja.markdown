NPR's Morning Edition <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93769638">interviewed Beck</a> this morning about <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Guilt-Beck/dp/B0019GAOI2">Modern Guilt</a></em>, and, of course, his relationship with his grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus">Fluxus</a> member <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hansen">Al Hansen</a>. I love this image of Hansen sending his grandkids to scour restaurants for cigarette butts out of ashtrays:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"He liked to say he was an alchemist," Beck says. "But really, it was that he was broke. He couldn't afford art materials. So I think he decided early on, 'I'm going to make art out of what I have around,' which was candy wrappers and cigarette butts. When I was a child, he used to send us to the garbage can. When we were at a restaurant, we'd go to all the ashtrays that were left — we used to collect all the cigarette butts for him for his artwork."</p>

<p>Now <em>that's</em> grandparenting.</p>
