National Geographic has a [nice collection of photos of the LHC at CERN](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/03/god-particle/ginter-photography.html), including this one of Peter Glaessel, a technical coordinator sitting inside the "[time projection chamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber)."

In other news, JJ Abrams debuted his new TV series _[Fringe](http://www.fox.com/fringe/)_ last night, which based on the pilot promises a full season of not-even-pseudoscience, completely improbable situations, ridiculous conspiracy theories and awkward love interests. I'm personally hoping for a Large Hadron Collider guest appearance coupled with a time travel / black hole plotline somewhere around episode 8. Talk about product placement opportunities...
