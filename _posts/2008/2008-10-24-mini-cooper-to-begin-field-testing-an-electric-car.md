I'm sure this has been covered to death on the autoblogs, but I learned about it via Mini USA's email list: they're looking for 500 drivers in Southern California, New York and New Jersey to participate in a [field trial of the MINI E](http://www.miniusa.com/?eid=177&tid=624&deepLink=/learn/MINIE-m&pid=3270185#/learn/MINIE-m), "a 100% electric, zero-emission premium vehicle ready for every-day driver use."

*   Lithium-ion batteries
*   Two-seater only; what's normally the backseat in a Mini is now full of batteries
*   Zero to 60 in about 8.5 seconds; top speed electronically limited to about 95mph
*   Range of about 150 miles
*   Full recharge draws 28 kilowatt hours, which equates to 5.4 miles / kwh
*   If you pay $0.15 / kwh, that equates to about about $0.03 per mile, which is about one-third the cost per mile of Mini Cooper.\[1\]

Of course, next to the [Pious](http://www.fuelly.com/driver/sippey/prius) there couldn't be a more latte-sippin' blue state car than an electric Mini, and this one's only a pilot program, but I'm hopeful we'll see car makers push more hybrid and electric options...

\[1\] [Spreadsheet here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pn6BB13Um2z8YC5ea-k6MBA), based on an eyeballed average 30mpg for [Coopers on Fuelly](http://www.fuelly.com/car/mini/cooper/nozero) buying gas at $3.00 per gallon, which is about where the [national average](http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_home_page.html) is right now.
