Via [Waxy](http://waxy.org/links/), who is, actually, in Austin this weekend, [Mat Honan's post](http://www.emptyage.com/post/28223277) on his [fake stream](http://twitter.com/mat) of <140 char posts from southby. Worth quoting at length.

> So there I am. In Austin. Drunk. Foolish. Recklessly and unknowingly wealthy. Using pointless hashtags in my 140 character messages, and generally espousing the kind of optimistic hyperbolic nonsense that would indicate I have no memory of the years 1999 and 2000 when everyone with any sense realized itâ€™s just a business, and not some sort of Utopian Flan we shall all consume together in glory!
