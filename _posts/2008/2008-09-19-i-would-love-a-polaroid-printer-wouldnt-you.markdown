<p>Saw these Polaroids posted outside a local coffee shop this afternoon, and lamented the fact that I can't buy a simple Polaroid printer that takes my digital photos and prints perfect (or near-perfect) replicas of Polaroid snapshots. So my <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_FTW/">happy-go-lucky coffee partner</a> pointed out that Polaroid just released the <a href="http://www.polaroid.com/pogo/us/">PoGo printer</a> which is precisely <strong>not</strong> what I was thinking about.</p>
