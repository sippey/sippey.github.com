[DonorsChoose](http://donorschoose.org) is an incredible organization, using the web in a powerful way to connect individual donors with teachers to help address "the scarcity and inequitable distribution of learning materials and experiences in our public schools."  
  
They do an awful lot of things right on their site, but the thing I love most are the messages that are sent from the teachers whose projects you've funded. This message came from a project I helped fund with a small donation to bring art tables to a classroom in Northern California. It's a simple, straightforward way to help connect the dots between the gift and the kids it impacts.  
  
It's summertime, and teachers are getting ready for next year's classes -- why not [find a project to fund](http://donorschoose.org/)?
