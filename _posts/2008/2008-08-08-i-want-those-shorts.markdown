He&#39;s headed to the nationals.</p>

<p>Best quote: &quot;I play no instruments besides air guitar.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and while the video&#39;s good, it&#39;s rivaled by the front page of today&#39;s Chronicle Datebook section, which has an oversized, annotated photo of Koll doing his thing. Thinking of cutting it out and taping it up on my office wall.</p>
