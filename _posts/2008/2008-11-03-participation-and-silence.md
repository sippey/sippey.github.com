As part of the upcoming exhibition [The Art of Participation](http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/306) (which I'm looking forward to almost as much as the [Martin Puryear](http://sfmoma.org/exhibitions/334) show, which opens the same day), SFMOMA will be staging [performances of John Cage's _4'33"_](http://sfmoma.org/events/1258) in the galleries. Also part of the show are a few online works that will tickle the memories of oldtimers, including [Bumplist](http://www.bumplist.net/) and [Communimage](http://www.communimage.net/).
