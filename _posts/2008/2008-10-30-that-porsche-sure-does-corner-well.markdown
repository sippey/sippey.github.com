<p>Floyd Norris <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/business/worldbusiness/31norris.html">explains Porsche&#39;s corner strategy</a> on Volkswagen this week, which will likely end up netting them billions of euros. &quot;If this works, Porsche will have made billions from a car company at a
time when cars are not selling very well. ... If it comes to a question of whether regulators step in, Porsche has
the advantage of facing off against short-selling hedge funds. There
may not be a less popular group of investors, and their losses would
provoke little sympathy.&quot;</p><p>And yes, the post title is deliberately bad.</p>
