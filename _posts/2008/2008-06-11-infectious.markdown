Kudos to Tim Roberts on launching <a href="http://www.infectious.com/">Infectious</a>, his new company which brings easy-to-apply car art to the masses.  They've got simple icons, accent kits, hood pieces, door kits, side kits and full car customization kits -- all installable by normal humans.</p>

<p>Tim first told me about the idea for this company a few years ago (before he was at Odeo, I think?) and I'm really excited to see it come to life.  Their site is super fun to explore, and I can imagine all sorts of interesting ways they could drive more artwork into their catalog.  <a href="http://blog.infectious.com/">Their blog</a> is great, and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/22/infectious-to-bring-custom-car-art-to-the-masses/">Michael Arrington had a post</a> a couple of weeks ago with some video of just how easy it is to install the stickers on your car.</p>

<p>Now, to figure out just the right way to spice up the boring gray hybrid...</p>
