I went looking for a bit of Rauschenberg on YouTube this morning, and came across this quick [four and a half minute piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCWh3IFtDQ) on one of my favorites of his, the [Erased de Kooning Drawing](http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue8/erasuregenteel.htm), from 1953.

I love this bit, about a minute and a half in...

> "I kept making drawings myself and erasing them. And that just looked like an erased Rauschenberg. You know, it was nothing. So I figured out that it had to begin as art. So it was going to be a De Kooning. It was going to be an 'important' piece. You see how ridculously you have to think, in order to make this work?"

Michael Kimmelman's [obit in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/arts/design/14rauschenberg.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin) also captures this great Rauschenberg quote:

> "I really feel sorry for people who think things like soap dishes or mirrors or Coke bottles are ugly," he once said, "because theyâ€™re surrounded by things like that all day long, and it must make them miserable."
