Via [Modern Art Notes](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/07/tuesday_links_10.html), Time's Richard Lacayo on the [connection between Monet's _Water Lilies_ and Mark Rothko](http://time-blog.com/looking_around/2008/07/a_few_things_from_england.html) made real at Tate Modern.

> Going back and forth between the two canvases, you could understand in an almost physical way how Rothko's picture operates, how its vertical orientation and near human-scale dimensions, its direct address to your eye, brain and body, condenses the visual field of Monet's horizontal image and untethers it from its last connections to the visible world.

Yeah, art speak. I know. But if you're at all a Rothko fan, you'll _get it_. (Lacayo's piece has the images to prove his point, so, y'know, click through.)
