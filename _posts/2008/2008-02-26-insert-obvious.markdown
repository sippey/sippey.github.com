<p>There must be some German or French word for that oh-so-frequent combination of feeling &quot;not surprised in the slightest&quot; and &quot;jaw-droppingly amazed&quot; at the same time.&nbsp; <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080227/ap_on_go_co/white_house_e_mail;_ylt=AsOqcdHtpbWZ8TkkZNPDNs.s0NUE">From the AP</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There were no archived e-mails from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney from Sept. 30, 2003, to Oct. 6, 2003, just as the Justice Department was launching its investigation into whether anyone at the White House leaked Valerie Plame's CIA identity, according to documents provided to the House panel. The only e-mails that could be recovered for prosecutors were from the personal e-mail accounts of officials in Cheney's office, according to the report by Waxman's staff.</p></blockquote>
