I've [written before](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/06/one-reason-why-donorschoose-works-so-well.html) about [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/) and the incredible job they do connecting donors and teachers to help address the inequitable distribution of resources in our nation's public schools.

Last year DonorsChoose.org's blogger challenge helped impact more than 75,000 students in high need public schools. This year DonorsChoose is looking to blow that number out of the water with the **2008 Bloggers Challenge**. Some of my favorite blogs are participating -- including [Finslippy](http://finslippy.typepad.com/), [Fred Wilson](http://www.avc.com/) and the [Silicon Valley Moms Blog](http://www.svmoms.com/) \-\- helping DonorsChoose.org support specific teacher-driven projects in schools around the country.

This year I'm putting my weight behind Mena Trott's **[Nested and Dollarshort Challenge](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=18395)** which is a great collection of projects focused on arts, crafts and writing in early education. (And DonorsChoose.org made it easy for me to show my support since they support the TypePad Widget API for posting their widgets straight to my sidebar.)

Here's where to learn more, create your own challenge or support your favorite blogger!
