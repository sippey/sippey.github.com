Today, October 2, is "Peanuts day," since it marks the anniversary of the date of the first Peanuts cartoon in 1950. [Snoopy.com](http://www.snoopy.com/), the official online home of all things Peanuts, has [the first Peanuts comic strip](http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/meet_the_gang/meet_charlie_brown.html). Being a conscientious blogger, I won't just swipe and reprint it here -- you really should [click on through](http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/meet_the_gang/meet_charlie_brown.html).

What I love about that first strip is how true to form it is in terms of _tone_; sure the characters and their voices evolved over the years, but even the first one is spot on. (You can also learn at Snoopy.com that it took less than a year for Charlie Brown to first be called a blockhead.) My kids are getting into Peanuts now, and I need to put some of the [Peanuts box sets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=blended&keywords=peanuts%20box%20set&_encoding=UTF8) on my wishlist for Christmas, so they can spend extended periods of time soaking up "the strip's still-surprising balance of exuberance and misery."\[1\]

\[1\] That line's from the Amazon.com review of the [Schulz and Peanuts biography](http://www.amazon.com/Schulz-Peanuts-Biography-David-Michaelis/dp/0060937998/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222988116&sr=8-1). And you know what? I actually like most Amazon.com reviews.
