<p>Via <a href="http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3431/campaign-ad-maverick-maverick-maverick">Rogers Cadenhead</a> comes <a href="http://www.stunninglybad.com/">StunninglyBad.com</a> and this mock campaign ad from Goodby, Silverstein and Partners:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iwNvSW1Ge4M&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/iwNvSW1Ge4M&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>

<p>In his post, Rogers rightly wonders why the national treasure of sarcastic voiceover actors is only put to use only once every four years...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've thought for a while that the world needs an ad agency that specializes in creating attack ads for subjects outside of politics. Our most sarcastic voiceover actors shouldn't be put on a shelf for three out of every four years. If Madison Avenue can sell the most powerful job in the free world by employing sneering contempt for rivals, there's no reason the same technique can't be an effective way to sell things like erectile dysfunction medicine, soft drinks and public-service campaigns.</p>

<p>There's more ad agency presidential spin <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/special-reports/other-reports/e3iea21f1e730544128f8719de4ac9847f7?pn=5">at AdWeek.com</a>.</p>
