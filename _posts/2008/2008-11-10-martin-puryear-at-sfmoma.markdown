<p>The Martin Puryear show is all its cracked up to be.  I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/sets/72157608821062497/">snuck a few snapshots</a> at Friday night's opening before the guards told me to cut it out.  I like this one best...</p>

<p>Relatedly, <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2008/11/sfmoma_has_a_new_website.html">Tyler Green</a> takes the new <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/">SFMOMA website</a> to task. "You don't so much as see SFMOMA's website, you hold still while it throws itself at you."  That's good, but so is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>San Francisco is ground zero for web and software innovation, but you won't find evidence of that here. The museum hasn't tried to integrate much that's new and interesting -- say, Twitter -- into how it interacts with its audience, not does it provide new ways for its audience to interact with it. SFMOMA's site is mostly more of the same. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ran out of time and didn't see the Participation show, but <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/08/DDSP13VM63.DTL">Kenneth Baker</a> called it a "relic" in Saturday's paper.  Ouch.</p>
