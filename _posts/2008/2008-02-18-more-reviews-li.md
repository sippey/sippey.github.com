Wil Shipley of [Delicious Library](http://www.delicious-monster.com/) fame posts a [fantastic review of the Air](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/02/macbook-air-rambling-first-impressions.html), hitting all the right notes, including this pitch-perfect one:

> Jonathan Ive should design a laptop bag as beautiful as the Air, that just can contain the machine, a power cord, and a Wireless Mighty Mouse. I'd be in heaven. Nobody seems to have addressed the "I want a small, slim bag that can still hold a power cord without having a giant wart in the side" market. Like, duh, bag designers, STOW THE POWER CORD ABOVE OR BELOW THE LAPTOP, not STICKING OUT THE SIDE WHERE IT CREATES A TENT AND LOOKS UGLY AND BANGS MY KNEE.
