<p>Macworld is right around the corner and I thought I'd throw my two 
wishlist items out there, so that if they're actually delivered I can 
be that much happier than the next guy because I wrote my wishlist 
down. (Ah, the lessons of Santa.) Both wishes are iPhone-related, and 
both would make it a much better writing device. (2009 resolutions: 
stop carrying pens around, make significant progress in killing what 
remains of my penmanship, and quit fantasizing about that new Curve 
8900.)</p>

<p>First, landscape mode in email. I have big thumbs (all the better for 
hitchhiking!), and I find it much easier to type in landscape mode. I 
recently picked up the WriteRoom app for note taking, but that's five 
bucks I shouldn't have had to spend, as much as I enjoy supporting 
ISVs who ship elegant software that takes advantage of a weakness in 
their host.</p>

<p>Second, a haptic feedback option. There have been rumors on the 
internets for about a year now that Apple is partnering with a 
provider of haptic tech, but we've seen nothing yet. The touchscreen 
Blackerry tried to do this, but failed -- in the few minutes I spent 
with the device it just didn't feel right. (Then again, I've grown 
accustomed to the iPhone.) When I'm doing email I usually turn on the 
typing sound...but based on the occasional lag in the audible "click" 
from the speaker I'm not sure if the thing's fast enough to do a micro- 
vibrate-on-type right. If it worked, my gut is that it would help make 
typing on glass for more than a few sentences muuuuch more enjoyable.</p>

<p>It's 2009, the year of modest expectations. I'm not asking for a solid 
state sub $500 netbook, or a 7" iPod Touch or even a ship date for 
Snow Leopard. All I want is for the iPhone to be as great a device for 
content creation as it is for content consumption. A boy can dream, 
right?</p>
