I lurk on this great email list of project managers called [PMClinic](http://www.scottberkun.com/pmclinic/); it’s full of smart people who share war stories of (mostly software development) projects. It’s hosted by Scott Berkun (yes, [him again](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/its-new-to-you.html)) and each week one of the list members posts a challenging project scenario and the non-lurkers chime in with ideas and suggestions.

This week’s starter topic was a bit different though. The subject line was “Is there Project Management Lingo?” and there are about 60 some-odd responses, with people defining the terms they’ve come across; everything from “86’d” to “Whack-a-mole.” I took a few minutes to catalog all the terms (without definitions; I’m not a masochist); here they are\[1\], in alphabetical order.

*   86’d

My personal favorites are three of the ones I’d never heard before; compound words that even if they didn’t mean a thing just _sound_ great: consistify, arrivadodging and permalancing.

\[1\] Note that a few of the items in this list actually came from the comments in Scott Berkun’s [similar blog post](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2008/looking-for-project-management-slang/) about the PMClinic thread. Of course, this is not meant to be a full list of every single bit of project management lingo ever uttered by any project manager anywhere. Have one that’s not here? Leave it in the comments.
