<p>So while everything in <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2008/12/19/the-rolando-review/">Touch Arcade&#8217;s review</a> of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=299461156&amp;mt=8">Rolando</a> is true&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
Your job is to free the Rolandos from evil across 36 levels of play. The primary goal of each level is to free a minimum number of the Rolandos by getting them safely to the exit while avoid bad-guys and circumventing obstacles. Secondary goals includes collecting gems and beating the clock to increase your achievements and offer some additional replay value beyond the primarily plot.
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;the review doesn&#8217;t come close to capturing the joy of actually playing the game.  They roll!  They jump!  They bounce on things!  They call you Finger, and treat you like a deity!  Highly recommended iPhone fun; the perfect way to ignore your family this holiday season.</p>
