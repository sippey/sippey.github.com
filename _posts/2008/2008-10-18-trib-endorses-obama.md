[The Chicago Tribune endorses Barack Obama](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-chicago-tribune-endorsement,0,1371034.story): "This endorsement makes some history for the Chicago Tribune. This is the first time the newspaper has endorsed the Democratic Party's nominee for president." The comments on the [Chicagoist post](http://chicagoist.com/2008/10/17/trib_endorses_obama.php) on the endorsement are worth a skim: "Really, if the four horsemen come tap-dancing down ashland ave. I will not be shocked now."
