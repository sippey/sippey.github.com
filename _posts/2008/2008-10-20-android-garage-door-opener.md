Brad Fitzpatrick [is writing Android apps](http://brad.livejournal.com/2394220.html).

> My main Android app I care about is my garage door opener. I have a webserver hooked up \[to\] my garage door opener, so I can open my garage over the network. Combined with a background process doing wifi scanning, the idea's that when I'm on my way home, I pull up to my house on my motorcycle and the garage door magically opens and I back into my garage without taking off my helmet/gloves/etc.

If you've already hooked up a webserver to your garage door opener you're waaaaay down the path to madness, so you know, why the hell not build a mobile app to control it?
