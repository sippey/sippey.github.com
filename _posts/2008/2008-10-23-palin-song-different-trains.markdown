<p>Via Alex Ross at <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2008/10/political-music.html">The Rest is Noise</a> comes <em>Palin Song</em>, Henry Hey's piano accompaniment to Sarah Palin's interview with Katie Couric. Just press play and give it a minute to sink in...</p>

<p>As Ross points out, listeners who appreciate <em>Palin Song</em> may also appreciate Steve Reich's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Different_Trains">Different Trains</a></em>.  (If, like me, you're too lazy to click through to anything, here's a relevant snippet from Wikipedia: "In <em>Different Trains</em>, after each melody in the piece is introduced...a recording of the spoken phrase from which the melody derives is played.")</p>
