Moving on from the runaway children of _Beautiful Children_ (deep cleansing breaths, wash hands well with scalding hot water, hug kids one extra time before bed) to the three roving packs of werewolves in Toby Barlow's new novel-in-verse _[Sharp Teeth](http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Teeth-Toby-Barlow/dp/0061430226/statingtheobvioua)_. I seem to have missed the cultural pivot point when books began to have full blown [flash-intro websites](http://sharpteeththebook.com/) with viral video, but check out this little ditty, which will help you determine once and for all if your dog is a werewolf.
