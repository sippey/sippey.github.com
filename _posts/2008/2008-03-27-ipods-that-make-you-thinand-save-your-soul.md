I love this little tidbit from the [Apple patent filing](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/03/27/apple_developing_full_fledge_digital_lifestyle_fitness_companion.html) today...

> The lifestyle companion system also can interview the user about non-health related topics, e.g., spirituality/religion, identity (e.g., sense of belonging), relationships, career, financial condition, environment, hobbies, interests, other personal information, and goals regarding the same.Â 

Can't wait to see the privacy policy on that one.
