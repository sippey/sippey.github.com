Regardless of your feelings for either Ronald Reagan or William F. Buckley, you have to appreciate what the great communicator had to say about the "polysyllabic" champion of conservatism.  This Reagan quote is pulled from the [Times obit of Buckley](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/media/27cnd-buckley.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin)...

> "You didn't just part the Red Sea -- you rolled it back, dried it up and left exposed, for all the world to see, the naked desert that is statism.  And then, as if that weren't enough, you gave the world something different, something in its weariness it desperately needed, the sound of laughter and the sight of the rich, green uplands of freedom."

But somehow I doubt that Reagan wrote that himself... Sounds a lot like [Peggy Noonan](http://www.amazon.com/What-Saw-Revolution-Political-Reagan/dp/0812969898/statingtheobvioua), no?
