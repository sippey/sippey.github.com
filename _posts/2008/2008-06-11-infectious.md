Kudos to Tim Roberts on launching [Infectious](http://www.infectious.com/), his new company which brings easy-to-apply car art to the masses. They've got simple icons, accent kits, hood pieces, door kits, side kits and full car customization kits -- all installable by normal humans.

Tim first told me about the idea for this company a few years ago (before he was at Odeo, I think?) and I'm really excited to see it come to life. Their site is super fun to explore, and I can imagine all sorts of interesting ways they could drive more artwork into their catalog. [Their blog](http://blog.infectious.com/) is great, and [Michael Arrington had a post](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/22/infectious-to-bring-custom-car-art-to-the-masses/) a couple of weeks ago with some video of just how easy it is to install the stickers on your car.

Now, to figure out just the right way to spice up the boring gray hybrid...
