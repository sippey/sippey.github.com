**Last night, 10:30 pm:**  Finished watching our Tivo'd version of the Oscars.  Ba-boop'd our way through the montages.  Did email during some of the songs.  Didn't liveblog.

**Last night, 10:40 pm:**  Check in on Vox neighborhood.  Hey, [Anil liveblogged the Oscars](http://anil.vox.com/library/post/its-the-oscars-tee-em.html)!  Skim skim skim, scroll scroll, scroll.  Here's a funny line: "Poor Nicole Kidman, ruined herself. Used to be fetching. I'm just saying. I do like her brave choice to wear a chandelier."

**Last night, 11:30 pm:**  Oh, hey, looks like [Jason liveblogged not watching the Oscars](http://www.kottke.org/08/02/liveblogging-the-oscars). How clever.  "My liveblogging outfit this evening: jeans by Banana Republic, long sleeve tshirt by American Apparel, socks by Wal-Mart, boxer shorts by Muji." (Ahem, that sounds like a series of Facebook is statements to me.)

**This morning, 11:00 am:**  Wow, [David liveblogged 'em](http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2008/02/liveblogging-th.html), too.  "I think Owen Wilson should take over Heath Ledger's career."  Yes!  Excellent idea. Couldn't have said it better myself.

**This morning, 11:25 am:** OK, that's enough.
