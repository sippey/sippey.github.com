I'm sure this has been covered to death on the autoblogs, but I learned about it via Mini USA's email list:  they're looking for 500 drivers in Southern California, New York and New Jersey to participate in a <a href="http://www.miniusa.com/?eid=177&amp;tid=624&amp;deepLink=/learn/MINIE-m&amp;pid=3270185#/learn/MINIE-m">field trial of the MINI E</a>, "a 100% electric, zero-emission premium vehicle ready for every-day driver use."</p>

<ul>
<li>Lithium-ion batteries</li>
<li>Two-seater only; what's normally the backseat in a Mini is now full of batteries</li>
<li>Zero to 60 in about 8.5 seconds; top speed electronically limited to about 95mph</li>
<li>Range of about 150 miles</li>
<li>Full recharge draws 28 kilowatt hours, which equates to 5.4 miles / kwh</li>
<li>If you pay $0.15 / kwh, that equates to about about $0.03 per mile, which is about one-third the cost per mile of Mini Cooper.[1]</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, next to the <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/driver/sippey/prius">Pious</a> there couldn't be a more latte-sippin' blue state car than an electric Mini, and this one's only a pilot program, but I'm hopeful we'll see car makers push more hybrid and electric options...</p>

<p>[1] <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pn6BB13Um2z8YC5ea-k6MBA">Spreadsheet here</a>, based on an eyeballed average 30mpg for <a href="http://www.fuelly.com/car/mini/cooper/nozero">Coopers on Fuelly</a> buying gas at $3.00 per gallon, which is about where the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_home_page.html">national average</a> is right now.</p>
