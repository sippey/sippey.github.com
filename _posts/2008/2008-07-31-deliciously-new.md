Congrats to the delicious team on the launch of the new [delicious.com](http://www.delicious.com/). As an [active user](http://delicious.com/msippey), I've been looking forward to the refresh for a little while now, and I'm happy to have it live! Here are a few of the things I like...

*   Date grouping! It's a simple thing, but it really makes it visually clear how much linking activity I've been doing lately.
    
*   Top ten tags! I'm pretty sure I could have done that before with the controls that were there, but the new look of that right-hand module is clean, simple and straightforward.
    
*   Tag intersection UI! While the visual look implies more of a category > subcategory model instead of a pure tag intersection model, the way they've implemented it will make me much more likely to go to my archives to find things like "[small+software](http://delicious.com/msippey/software+small)."
    
*   Long notes! Yeah, I like them [too](http://www.43folders.com/2008/07/31/delicious-relaunch).
    
*   The launch video! Definitely [worth watching](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deliciousblog/2718285703/), especially if you're one of those people (like me) who likes words moving around on a screen.
    

And since it wouldn't be fair and balanced without one thing I'm not a fan of, I'll share this:

*   I'm not a fan of the new little "person" that's there. I've always loved the simple delicious identity of the blue, black and white favicon; I'm not sure that the bookmark needed to be anthropomorphized.

To date I've shared 1,254 bookmarks on delicious. Here's to the next 1,254!
