From the best of Craigslist, [Facebook: I love to hate you](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/ott/363794217.html).Â  "First of all, you allow people from high school that I've never even spoken to add me as their friend. I dont know them other than the fact that we were apparently in the same homeroom together in grade 9 before I got the braces off. Its creepy that they remember the overalls and the plaid raincoat I was wearing the first day of high school. Please do not allow these people to seek me out."
