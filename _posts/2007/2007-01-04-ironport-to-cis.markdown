Congrats to Scott Weiss and the whole crew at Ironport ([read the announcement](http://www.ironport.com/company/ironport_pr_2007-01-04.html) \-\- bought by Cisco for $800mm in cash and stock).  I had a chance to meet Scott back when email was my life, and from the beginning it was clear they were building a great product and a great company.  Kudos!
