Recommended: Florian Balmer's [notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) (for Windows), "a fast and light-weight Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting."Â  Free, simple, well-designed and gets out of your way and lets you focus on what you're supposed to be doing, which is writing and editing gobs and gobs of Markdown.
