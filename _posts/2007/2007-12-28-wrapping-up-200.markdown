<p>If there's one "2007 wrap up" post you need to read, it's <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2007/12/28/wrapping_up_2007">this one from Matt Webb</a>. It's smart, not easily digestible, and will send your mind reeling for more than a little while. (Kind of like Mr. Webb himself.)  Here's a teaser bit for you, on the nature of websites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of a finite-state machine, think of a website as a flowchart of motivations. For every state the user is in, there are motivations: it's fun; it's the next action; it saves money; it's intriguing; I'm in flow; I need to crop the photo and I remember there's a tool to do it on that other page; it's pretty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's more on vending machines, risk as motivation, playfulness, the Magna Carta, flocking cars and phenotropics. Fun!</p>
