Richard Dorment slams [Documenta 12](http://www.documenta12.de/aktuelles.html?&L=1), calling it [the worst art show ever](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/06/19/badocumenta119.xml "The worst art show ever - Telegraph").  "Entirely absent from almost every work on view is a sense of emotional depth, ambiguity, or psychological or moral complexity."  Ouch.
