The Times Travel section <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/travel/25journeys.html?ex=11967">covers Art Basel Miami Beach</a> and the satellite fairs that will invade Miami next week. There's so much going on that the director of Art Miami advises visitors to &quot;make a spreadsheet and write in what shows they want to see and hours and locations in order to plot their course.&quot; If you're not familiar with the spectacle that's Miami Basel, it's not your typical open studio weekend. For proof, check out the <a href="http://www.artbaselmiamibeach.com/go/id/bbo/">list of event sponsors</a>. (Think NetJets, Cartier &amp; UBS.)</p>

<p>If you're one of the lucky tens of thousands who'll be there, make sure to visit the <a href="http://www.aquaartmiami.com/wyn.html">Aqua Wynwood</a> satellite fair and stop by <a href="http://www.traywick.com/">Traywick Contemporary</a>. Lots of great work's been packed up and shipped for your visual pleasure; tell the wonderful gallerist I sent you.<br /> </p>
