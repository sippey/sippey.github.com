If there's one "2007 wrap up" post you need to read, it's [this one from Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org/home/2007/12/28/wrapping_up_2007). It's smart, not easily digestible, and will send your mind reeling for more than a little while. (Kind of like Mr. Webb himself.) Here's a teaser bit for you, on the nature of websites:

> Instead of a finite-state machine, think of a website as a flowchart of motivations. For every state the user is in, there are motivations: it's fun; it's the next action; it saves money; it's intriguing; I'm in flow; I need to crop the photo and I remember there's a tool to do it on that other page; it's pretty.

There's more on vending machines, risk as motivation, playfulness, the Magna Carta, flocking cars and phenotropics. Fun!
