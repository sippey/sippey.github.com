[Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/07/09/virtual-book-tours-the-origins-of) (and [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Virtual_Book_Tours)! and the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/fashion/02blog.html?ex=1346299200&en=988f9e2ea5809708&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink)!) on virtual book tours, which would have been the more appropriate option for the guy hawking his September 11 historical fiction / conspiracy theory tome at McCarran Interational Airport in Las Vegas last week.
