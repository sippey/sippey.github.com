[Errol Morris is blogging](http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/) at nytimes.com on photography, and [kicks it off](http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/pictures-are-supposed-to-be-worth-a-thousand-words/) with a post on the relationship between photos, their captions and "truth."

> Truth or falsity “adheres” not to the photograph itself but to the statements we make about a photograph. Depending on the statements, our answers change. All alone — shorn of context, without captions — a photograph is neither true nor false.
