Erick Schonfeld on [The Web Widget](http://blogs.business2.com/business2blog/2007/01/2007_the_web_wi.html "The Next Net: 2007: The Web Widget"):

> The reason Web widgets are important is because they are the most concrete manifestation of something else that is happening.  The Web is splintering.

Splintering away from the portals, sure, and then reaggregating in places where individual expression happens - blogs, profile pages, etc.  Widgets are another point in the trendline of cut-and-paste culture:  mix and match content and functionality to fit my personality, my blog, my audience.
