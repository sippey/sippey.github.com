I followed a link from somewhere today to The New York Times list of [The 10 Best Books of 2007](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/10-best-2007.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin),  and was completely floored by the photo illustration that accompanied the piece.  It was pretty much perfect: of course, _these_ are the ten best books of 2007. These ones, right here.  The ones arranged here ready to be put up on your shelf.

If you knew the spines, the text of the piece was pretty much irrelevant -- paragraph long descriptions of each of the titles. And while I admit that I live so far inside baseball that I'm buried under the mound, the simplicity of the photo felt like the perfect antidote to the past couple of weeks of Kindlemania. These are the 10 worth owning...in hardback.
