Note to self:  you have a very short attention span, as measured in the meantime between overhauls of your blog's look and feel.  Short story:  I fell in love with one of the new themes that Walt had put together for TypePad, and just had to apply it here.  Oh, and I'm sure there will be all sorts of Google weirdness with the flipping back and forth with the content on /unfiltered and now here back on /filtered, but we'll suffer through. I know everyone liked the new look (so did I!) but there's something comfortable and familiar about two-column right.

Anyway, we're back [here](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/) for now.
