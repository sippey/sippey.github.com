The SJ Merc [reviews](http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_6720207?nclick_check=1) the Wilco show [I saw](http://michael.vox.com/library/post/wilco-show-at-the-greek.html) last weekend. (Via [The Standing Room](http://www.thestandingroom.com/blog/2007/08/california-star.html).)

> Glenn Kotche ... can take a simple dusty acoustic riff in more directions than perhaps any rock drummer in existence. ... Tweedy's the brains, Cline and guitarist/keyboardist Pat Sansone are the electricity, and bassist John Stirratt is the rock. Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen is the musical icing. But Kotche is what makes this band go, and it's wonderful to watch.

Hooray for drummers!
