Via [Modern Art Notes](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/) comes the [Indianapolis Museum of Art Dashboard](http://dashboard.imamuseum.org/), which gives a view into some of the metrics the museum tracks about its operations. Attendance as a percentage of population, percentage of attendance from museum members, number of pieces on loan to other institutions, percentage of Indianapolis third graders that have visited the museum this year, etc.
