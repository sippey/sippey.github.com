Chef [Grant Achatz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Achatz) of [Alinea](http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/) has been [diagnosed](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/a-chefs-toughest-challenge/) with [squamous cell carcinoma](http://www.skincancer.org/squamous/index.php) of the mouth. His statement:

> I wanted to personally report that I have been very recently diagnosed with an advanced stage of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the mouth. I have consulted several prominent physicians and will likely begin aggressive treatment within the next few weeks. I remain, and will remain, actively and optimistically engaged in operations at Alinea to the largest extent possible. Alinea will continue to perform at the level people have come to expect from us -- I insist on that. I have received amazing support from friends, family, and everyone who has thus far been told of the disease, and I look forward to a full, cancer-free, recovery.
