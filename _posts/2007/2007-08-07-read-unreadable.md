From the Gawker media site that everyone loves to love, news that [Courtney Thorne-Smith  has a new book](http://gawker.com/news/gawker-book-club/courtney-thorne+smith-understands-suffering-286763.php), titled _[Outside In](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767927494/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/)_.  The only thing you need to know is this delicious adjective from Emily Gould:  "unghostwritten."
