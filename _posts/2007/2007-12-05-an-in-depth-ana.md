This whole "no Daily Show" thing\[1\] really sucks ass.\[2\]

\[1\] I mean, seriously. There's a whole new [National Intelligence Estimate on Iran](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/world/middleeast/06intel.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin) and all of us self-satisfied armchair liberals are stuck looking for the humor in [Tom Friedman columns](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html?n=Top/Opinion/Editorials%20and%20Op-Ed/Op-Ed/Columnists). Shoot me now.

\[2\] Classy, eh?
