<p><a href="http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/declaration.html">It's worth reading again</a>.</p><blockquote><p>That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to
institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p></blockquote>
