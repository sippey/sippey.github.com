Chronicle sports columnist Gwen Knapp [on the Bonds indictment](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/11/16/MN3STDMPH.DTL):

> If Bonds is guilty, the best outcome would be a plea agreement, requiring him to say aloud what really happened. The BALCO prosecution started with the mission of cleaning up sports, and a long jail term can't match the effect of a confession from a superstar.
