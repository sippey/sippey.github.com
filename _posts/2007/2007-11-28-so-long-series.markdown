<p>Our beloved Tivo Series 1 kicked the bucket this week, dying a wheezing, whining, hard-drive clicking death after more than seven years of reliable service.*</p>

<p>Normally I'm not the type to mourn the passing of a device -- after all, how many have I willingly <del>tossed</del> recycled in the same period?&nbsp; But there's something to be said for that simple, well-designed box that changed the way we watch television.&nbsp; It paused while we went for popcorn, treated us to the entire back catalog of Sports Night, reliably delivered hundreds if not thousands of hours of season passes week after week, and kept us sane and entertained during countless 3am feedings.</p>

<p>Rest in peace, old friend. The house may be quieter without the constant whine of your tired, old, underpowered and undersized hard drive, but trust us -- we'll miss you.</p>

<p>* Don't panic, though, we have a Series 2 in the living room; the Series 1 was the luxurious <em>second</em> Tivo that lately was responsible for recording endless episodes of Arthur and Mickey's Clubhouse. Sorry, kids.</p>
