Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche will be [performing](http://www.sfjazz.org/concerts/2007/fall/artists/KronosKotche.asp) with Kronos Quartet as part of the SF Jazz festival in October. They'll be premiering a new piece by Kotche, "Anomaly." Looking forward to that. As Anil says, drummers always love the drummers.
