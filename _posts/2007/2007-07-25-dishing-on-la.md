Michael Bauer (SF Chron food critic) visits LA and manages to [dismiss an entire city full of restaurants](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/25/FDMMR66A917.DTL) in 500ish words.Â  "In the Bay Area, food is the driving force of successful restaurants. But in L.A., instead of paying attention to what's on the plate, just about everyone is rubbernecking to see who's in the house."
