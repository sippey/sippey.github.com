Holy cow, [futurefeedforward](http://futurefeedforward.com/) lives! My inbox told me that "[Socal Skyfires Torch Subprime Skytellites](http://futurefeedforward.com/front.php?fid=103)."

> The airborne fires, some of which have burned for more than nine days, are fueled by thermobaric clouds of atomized landfill and other condensing nano-particulates disbursed into the upper atmosphere by disposal units commonly used in the county's tethered, low-earth-orbit neighborhoods. The roiling clouds of burning waste-vapor have been described by local witnesses as both "apocalyptic" and "breathtaking." "I mean, I've seen the entire rainbow in those fires," notes William Lennox, 43, a Plato Verde dentist and father of two. "The heat is incredible, and the smell, but the colors are really what gets you. The sky is literally burning, but the colors are just amazing."

They're also working on [a novel](http://futurefeedforward.com/novel.php).
