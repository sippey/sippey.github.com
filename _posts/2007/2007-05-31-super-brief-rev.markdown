<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596911042/statingtheobviou"><img width="150" height="150" border="0" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/images/2007/05/31/jpodmedium_2.jpg" title="Jpodmedium_2" alt="Jpodmedium_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>It seems like such a good idea on the surface:&nbsp; a thick new Coupland in paperback (after all, you wouldn't buy it in hardback, would you?), with the cute lego characters on the cover, and the &quot;it's almost like Microserfs but set in a game company this time&quot; vibe.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But about halfway through, when you realize that <em>two</em> of the main characters have parents who grow marijuana for a living <em>and</em> a character named Douglas Coupland is going to play a pivotal role in the plot, you start to lose interest.&nbsp; But because you're on vacation, and you can't stand the thought of driving up the strip to the supersized Barnes &amp; Noble to pick up a new read, you power through.&nbsp; And then, about three quarters of the way through, when he actually includes the first 100,000 digits of Pi in the text, you start to wonder &quot;just where the hell was his editor?&quot; and give up hope completely.</p>
