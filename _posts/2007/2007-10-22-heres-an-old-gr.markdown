<p>From Stating the Obvious, February 1997: <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/network/">The Network Diagram</a>.&nbsp; &quot;I've abandoned link list. In its place I've drawn this simple diagram, a roadmap to the self-absorbed world of Internet publishing. Six degrees of separation? Ha. Try two at the most.&quot;</p>

<p>Extra credit for identifying the publications that still exist.</p>
