From Katherine Boehret's [review of the Wildpad](http://solution.allthingsd.com/20071128/a-pad-to-easily-power-up-your-phone/):

> The pad, from WildCharge Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz. ([www.wildcharge.com](http://www.wildcharge.com/)), eliminates the messy tangle of wires that many people struggle with each time they want to charge their portable devices. But more to the point, it turns charging a gadget into something that happens in the background rather than an active task. And it spares you from that nagging question: Did I remember to plug my phone or iPod or BlackBerry in before going to sleep?

Thank GOD charging my phone is now something that happens in the background. I can't tell you how much mental energy I've wasted over the years on that incredibly active task.
