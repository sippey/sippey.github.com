Small Macintosh OS X Leopard hint, first in a series of one, because I usually don't do this kind of thing. If you have a local mail folder named "notes" you need to rename it before Mail will let you save a new note you create.Â  Otherwise you will get an error message that reads "The note could not be saved." May legions of Leopard users find this blog post through the wonders of Google and save themselves just a little bit of time.
