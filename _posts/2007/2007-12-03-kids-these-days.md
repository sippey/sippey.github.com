From Slate's [review](http://www.slate.com/id/2179047/) of Steve Martin's new book comes this depressing tidbit:Â  "According to the census bureau, roughly 40 percent of the American populace was born after 1981, which means that Steve Martin has not been a stand-up comedian in their lifetime."

This was the review's _lede_. I had to simply stop reading; it was just too depressing. I have no idea whether or not they thought the book was any good.
