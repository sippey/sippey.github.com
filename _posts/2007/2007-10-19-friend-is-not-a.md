title: "friend is not a verb"

Spent a little bit of time at the Web 2.0 summit this afternoon, with the express intent of catching the following early afternoon lineup:  Kedrosky, Butterfield, Recordon & Fitzpatrick and then Safa Rashtchy's panel discussion with a group of baby boomers about how they use the web. Kedrosky convinced me that I need to learn more about [dark pools](http://www.advancedtrading.com/directories/darkpool/); Stewart showed off some really sexy new photo mapping features coming soon to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), and Safa's panel was as entertaining and enlightening as ever.  ([This couple](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-2ep2ivmaBE) was on the panel, and they were _great_.)

I'm admittedly biased, but the highlight for me was David and Brad. They did a great job of laying out the problem of closed social networks: as more and more applications benefit from social interaction, connecting those apps to an appropriate set of your friends will become a more frequent occurrence. In short, soon you will be very very tired of using the word "friend" as a verb, if you're not already.

The solution is a combination of a technology tools, a mindset change, and user education.  The technology stuff is basically there -- XFN, FOAF and OAuth, for example -- and is being demonstrated now in the [Six Apart Relationship Update Stream](http://updates.elsewhere.im/) that David announced today. The mindset change requires social network operators to open up that data, which will come, even if it takes a while. The education piece is about providing simple user experiences that (a) teach users how this works and (b) shows them the value of expressing at least a portion of their graph publicly and (c) allows them to control and maintain their relationship data.

David's got a post up on [O'Reily Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/web2summit_soci_1.html) that summarizes their talk; it's a good followup to his post on [Opening the Social Graph](http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/09/were_opening_th.html) at sixapart.com.
