<p>Paging Chris Anderson, this is the long tail market for words in action.&nbsp; While browsing through an archived gmail conversation with a friend, I notice these ads on the right:</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1997/12/29.html" title="i wrote this toss off piece in 1997 that's essentially adwords for email"><img border="0" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/06/existentialadvertising.png" /></a></p></blockquote><p>These are sponsored links, mind you.&nbsp; &quot;A clue offered, substitute the word aesthetic for spirit&quot; is possibly the most obscure advertising copy I've ever read.</p>
