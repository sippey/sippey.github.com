I suspect that there is a very small intersection between the set of people who appreciate [lolcats](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html) and the set of people who appreciate [Jenny Holzer](http://twitter.com/jennyholzer). If, like me, you find yourself in that intersection, [you will most likely appreciate these loljennyholzers](http://djchall.vox.com/library/posts/tags/loljennyholzer/).
