[![Skybluesky](https://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/images/2007/12/05/skybluesky.jpg "Skybluesky")](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000NVIGC0/statingtheobviou)[Fluxblog](http://www.fluxblog.org/), my favorite music blog of the year, [on Wilco's Sky Blue Sky](http://www.fluxblog.org/2007/12/dark-green-enough-to-be-blue.html), which has been in heavy rotation in our house since release: "Most of the worst reviews for the record glibly dismissed the music as 'dad rock,' which is sort of aggravating because I think that the epithet accidentally touches on the stoicism and maturity that is key to the record's appeal, but favors a kneejerk appreciation of less emotionally (or musically) complicated music."
