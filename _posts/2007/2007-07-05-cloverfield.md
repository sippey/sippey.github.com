The Cloverfield trailer is still up at [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/videos/relevance/search/cloverfield/1 "Dailymotion - Share Your Videos"), but was pulled by YouTube.  Slashfilm has a [good roundup](http://www.slashfilm.com/tag/cloverfield/) of the latest about the JJ Abrams project.  (Every report I heard from TED this year was that Abrams had one of the best talks (keywords: magic, mystery, storytelling, an unopened box); I'm hoping it goes up on [ted.com](http://www.ted.com/) soon.)
