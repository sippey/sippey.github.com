News to me, but Radiohead's catalog isn't available on iTunes. Instead, [they're on ateaseweb.com](http://www.ateaseweb.com/2007/09/18/radiohead-catalogue-available-in-high-quality-download/), with full albums available in DRM free 320kbs MP3s. The statement from EMI is interesting: "iTunes insists that all its albums are sold unbundled, but 7digital doesnâ€™t. Radiohead prefer to have their albums sold complete. The artist has a choice, and if they feel strongly then we respect that." (Via [TRIN](http://www.therestisnoise.com/).)
