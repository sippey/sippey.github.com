Saturday's Times [profiled artist Paul Chan](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/arts/design/02cott.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1196661257-hsM1VQxolNT3IcJETqu3EA) and his work in New Orleans, especially his [outdoor stagings](http://flickr.com/photos/jonnodotcom/1859053560/) of Waiting for Godot in the Lower Ninth and Gentilly neighborhoods. I loved the description, though of the signs Chan [put up all over the city](http://flickr.com/photos/jonnodotcom/1849834693/in/set-72057594137279199/), in advance of the performances...

> Sometime in October, new words began to appear. Printed on small cardboard signs, they consisted of the same three phrases: “A country road. A tree. Evening.” — an exact quotation of Beckett’s scene-setting for “Godot.”
> 
> The signs were designed by Mr. Chan and posted all over the city, in a distribution pattern that had a rhythm of surprise. Drive through a “good” neighborhood or a “bad” neighborhood and you’d spot one. At a traffic light, another one. On the boarded window of an abandoned shopping mall, another.
> 
> After a while the signs came to feel like a shared secret, or some bounteous but anonymous civic gift, the way Keith Haring’s subway paintings felt in New York in the early 1980s. They added up to a visual network, art as a connective tissue for a torn-apart town.

The whole piece is worth reading, as is [this one from Doug MacCash and David Cuthbert](http://blog.nola.com/davidcuthbert/2007/11/artist_paul_chan_brings_his_go.html) of the Times-Picayune.
