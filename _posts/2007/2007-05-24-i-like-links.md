Not everything gets shared on delicious, and while I love reading my friends' automated daily link posts, when I turn them on here I always feel like they're a little bit spammy, not quite filtered enough.  Nevertheless, I like links.  And you like links.  So here are some links.

*   You're reading Tim Goodman, right?  The guy's on fire.  Two great wrapups this week -- of [The Sopranos](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&entry_id=16807) and [Lost](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&entry_id=16760).  (Oh, and SBJ had a [great nugget](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/05/last_nights_los.html) on Lost as well.)  It seems all I'm talking about over on [Vox](http://michael.vox.com/) is television, but here's something that's bugging me.  If you're a fan, and you're not watching the night of the episode, then don't bitch about spoilers.  All over the office today "Shut up! Don't talk about Lost! I haven't watched it yet!"  Come on, people -- if you're a fan, you _watch_.
*   [Fred Wilson on Wesabe](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/05/delicious_for_m.html):  it's about social and tagging.  I used to be a huge Quicken user (I even categorized the cash I spent -- to the dollar granularity), but am no longer.  I keep meaning to try Wesabe, but I'm more than a little bit afraid of what I'll learn.
*   The Hatch Design Blog [featured a great pic of the Ring House](http://blog.designpublic.com/2007/05/23/beautiful-japanese-design-ring-house-in-japan/) outside Tokyo.  It took my breath away.
*   [ReCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html) looks cool...
*   Kara Swisher [on Facebook](http://kara.allthingsd.com/20070524/facebooks-next-steps-still-to-come-a-tv-show/) is worth a read...and she outs the plans for a Facebook TV show.  The Kara v. Arrington spat is also great sport, but not worth the href.
*   And speaking of warring factions I really wanted to watch the [Civil War condensed down to four minutes](http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/05/13471.html), but the video seems to have been disappeared from YouTube.

If you didn't catch that, I just compared a silly spat between two journalists covering Web 2.0 to the most tragic war in our nation's history.  Now _that's_ blogging.
