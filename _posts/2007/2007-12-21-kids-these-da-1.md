I don't think it was this piece, but some quick hit on Morning Edition covering some aspect of the [new Pew research about online identity](http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/229/report_display.asp) and self-Googling, where someone quoted finally made the point that one approach for managing your online identity is to actually _post more and more content under your own name_. Bloggers have known this for years -- you want to own the Google search results for your name -- and it's nice to hear this thinking finally make its way into the mass media.  
  
But really, this is just an excuse to experiment with a new type of news blogging -- taking a quick picture of the story you find while leafing through the morning's paper...instead of going to the trouble finding the story and actually linking to it. Plus, it was a way to sneak Santa Claus on to the blog...so a big "ho ho ho" to all you Christmas celebrators out there.
