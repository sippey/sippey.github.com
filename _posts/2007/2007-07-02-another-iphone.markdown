Another iPhone idea, from a conversation with xantus.  Run a slimp3 in your house as a music server, use your iPhone as the wifi device inside the house as the perfect remote for controlling your music library.  That's the near term solution; in the medium to longer term, you've gotta believe that the iPhone becomes the iTunes remote control for inside the home.
