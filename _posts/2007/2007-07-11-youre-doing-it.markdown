Jon Gruber on the reason 99% of email users will not live up to the Official Daring Fireball expectations for [appropriate use of electronic mail](http://daringfireball.net/2007/07/on_top):  "The fundamental source of poor email style is the practice of quoting the _entire message_ you’re replying to."  I used to care about things like this.  Then I stopped caring...right around the time I stopped caring about whether people sent me email in plain text. Life's been a lot simpler ever since.
