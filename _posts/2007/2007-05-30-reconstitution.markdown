It's early morning, and I'm walking through the Southwest Florida International Airport, doing my best to ignore the piped in Muzak.  But the task becomes impossible when a watered down version of Billy Joel's "Just the Way You Are" comes on.  It's astonishing, but it is actually possible to water that song down.

I know there are a myriad of complicated licensing and performance rights issues that have brought us to the point where early morning travelers catch themselves singing "Don't go changing to try to please me" in time with an anonymous female song stylist.  But because I'm generally boring and single-tracked, I'm sitting here wondering what the online equivalent to Muzak is. F8? Widgets? RSS Readers? The mobile web? My Yahoo? The entire AOL experience?  When we add value do we water down? You've gotta believe that the people programming the Muzak channels believe they're doing Good Work, just like you.

Note to self: blog posts from airport terminals always _seem_ like a good idea.
