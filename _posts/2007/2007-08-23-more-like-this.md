What William Gibson is doing with _[Spook Country](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399154302/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/)_ and _[Pattern Recognition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425198685/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/)_ before it feels like what DeLillo was doing with _[The Names](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722955/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/)_ and his other books around that time (pre _[Libra](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141188227/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/)_): presenting the world that's invisible to us but we sense exists alongside ours.
