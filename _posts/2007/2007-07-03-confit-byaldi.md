Thomas Keller's [recipe for ratatouille](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/131rrex.html?ex=1339473600&en=20bf94f48570832f&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink "Recipe: Confit Byaldi - New York Times"); the one they make in the film.Â  Would be a great project with the kids after we go see the flick.
