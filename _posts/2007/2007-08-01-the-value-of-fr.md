Drew McManus, who writes the excellent blog [Adaptistration](http://www.artsjournal.com/adaptistration/) on arts administration, on reports that [free symphony concerts](http://www.artsjournal.com/adaptistration/archives/2007/07/some_good_quest.html) don't drive incremental ticket sales to paid events:Â  "I continue to think that the real failure of most free concerts has more to do with implementation and lack of adequate interaction between attendees and representatives of the orchestra."
