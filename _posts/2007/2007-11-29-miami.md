[![Artbasel](https://sippey.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/11/29/artbasel.jpg "Artbasel")](http://www.artbaselmiamibeach.com/go/id/ss/lang/eng/) The Times Travel section [covers Art Basel Miami Beach](http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/travel/25journeys.html?ex=11967) and the satellite fairs that will invade Miami next week. There's so much going on that the director of Art Miami advises visitors to "make a spreadsheet and write in what shows they want to see and hours and locations in order to plot their course." If you're not familiar with the spectacle that's Miami Basel, it's not your typical open studio weekend. For proof, check out the [list of event sponsors](http://www.artbaselmiamibeach.com/go/id/bbo/). (Think NetJets, Cartier & UBS.)

If you're one of the lucky tens of thousands who'll be there, make sure to visit the [Aqua Wynwood](http://www.aquaartmiami.com/wyn.html) satellite fair and stop by [Traywick Contemporary](http://www.traywick.com/). Lots of great work's been packed up and shipped for your visual pleasure; tell the wonderful gallerist I sent you.
