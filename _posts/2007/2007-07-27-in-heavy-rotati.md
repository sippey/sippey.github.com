Recommended: [The Mix-Up from Beastie Boys](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000PY32CE/statingtheobviou/ref=nosim/).  From Jason Kirk's Amazon review:  "The Beastie Boys now bring what feels like their emeritus recording, a celebratory instrumental memoir of all of the influences (except punk) that brought them to their secure place among hip-hop's fickle elite."  And yes, they sell it at Starbucks.  In fact, I hope they sell a _lot_ of them at Starbucks.
