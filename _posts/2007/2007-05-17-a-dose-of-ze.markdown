I've been missing my daily dose of [The Show](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/), so tonight I finally made the time to watch all 19 minutes and 58 seconds of Ze Frank's [February 2004 talk at TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/87).  It's well worth the extended dance remix attention disco.  (I mean, really, watching nearly 20 minutes of online video..._in a row_?  That has to be a personal best.)
