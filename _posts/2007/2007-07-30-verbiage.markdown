File under "the web creates unlimited column inches" and "where oh where have the editors gone" and "Q: How much do we love living in the first world? A: This much":  The Washington Post does [746 words on Hillary's cleavage](http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzz/Cleavage_for_President), and Tidbits does [2,200 on something called SafeSleep](http://db.tidbits.com/article/9090).  ("Look, it's 2007 and I'm a Mac user; if I can't put my brand new computer to sleep and into its bag in less than 10 seconds, something is _seriously wrong_." Emphasis mine.)
