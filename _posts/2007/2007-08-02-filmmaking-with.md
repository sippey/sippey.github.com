Manohla Dargis' [New York Times review of The Bourne Ultimatum](http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/movies/03bour.html?8dpc) has more than a few lines in it that I don't really understand but make me want to see the movie Right Now.

*   "This is the passion of Jason Bourne, with a bullet."
*   "...the more formally bold Mr. Greengrass shatters movie space like glass..."
*   "Itâ€™s filmmaking with a rubber hose."
*   "They take us inside an enormous train station and a cramped room and then, with whipping cameras and shuddering edits, break that space into bits as another bullet finds its mark, another body hits the ground, and the world falls apart just a little bit more."

OK, that last quote I understand. And seriously, I need to see this Right Now.
