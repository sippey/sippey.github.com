I just saw a television commercial for the upcoming DVD release of _Ratatouille_ that was unabashedly aspected 16:9. It stuck out because most movie commercials (esp for DVD releases) are formatted to fit your 4:3 screen... Of course the different look distracted me from the actual release date, though I'm assuming it'll be out in time for Thanksgiving.

Second order question: will the DVD drive incremental sales of Thomas Keller cookbooks?
