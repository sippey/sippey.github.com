Tyler Green [takes apart the Fine Arts Museum of San Franciso's program](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2007/08/kenneth_baker_prophet.html). Though it was site of probably the most beautiful wedding I've ever been to (save mine, of course), I'm not really a fan of the DeYoung as a museum. It's an interesting building (or, rather, it's a beautiful facade and a dramatic lobby), but I've always found the program confused (Sugimoto _and_ Annie Leibovitz?) and there are rarely shows that inspire me to encourage friends to take the trek to the park.

But Green, of course, is the much better blogger because back in February he [blogged a bunch of ideas to make FAMSF better](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2007/02/what_famsf_should_be_doing.html). Diebenkorn! Park! Maybeck! Morgan! Still! Yes yes yes! Please!
