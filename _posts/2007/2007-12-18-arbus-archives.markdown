<p>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/arts/design/18muse.html?_r=1&amp;ref=design&amp;oref=slogin">The Times</a>, news that The Met has been gifted the complete archives of Diane Arbus' estate, including &quot;hundreds of early and unique photographs; negatives and contract prints of 7,500 rolls of film; and hundreds of glassine print sleeves that she personally annotated before her death by suicide in 1971.&quot;&nbsp; And they've also purchased 20 of her signature photographs from Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco. </p>

<p>I love this quote from Jeff Rosenheim, a curator of photography at the Met...&nbsp; &quot;These pictures ask more questions than they answer. When you look at them, you almost feel as though you are having an interaction with the subject and the picture maker simultaneously. You are in a place where there is a lot of intimacy being shared.‚Äù</p>
