Sol LeWitt died yesterday at the age of 78.  From [Michael Kimmelman's obit](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/arts/design/09lewitt.html) at the Times:

> His work — sculptures of white cubes, or drawings of geometric patterns, or splashes of paint like Rorschach patterns — tested a viewer’s psychological and visual flexibility. See a line. See that it can be straight, thin, broken, curved, soft, angled or thick. Enjoy the differences. The test was not hard to pass if your eyes and mind were open, which was the message of Mr. LeWitt’s art.

LeWitt, probably more than anyone else, changed the way I thought about art.  A spit bite aquatint of his from [Crown Point Press](http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/lewitt/index.html) was a gift from my wife back when we first started dating; it's one of the most cherished things in our home.
