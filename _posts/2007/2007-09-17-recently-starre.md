For the record, recent things that won't dislodge from the top of the stack: Marc Andreessen on the [three kinds of platforms](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/09/the-three-kinds.html) (and, relatedly, some of the [new stuff](http://www.salesforce.com/force/) announced by Salesforce today); Cringely on the Goog's [plan for world domination](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070914_002928.html); Matt Webb's [experience stack](http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/09/09/the-experience-stack-revisited/); and Kottke's note on [impressionism v. realism in blogging](http://www.kottke.org/07/09/impressionism-realism-and-blogging).
