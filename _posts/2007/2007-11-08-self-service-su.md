Derek Gottfrid of the New York Times [describes](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/self-service-prorated-super-computing-fun/) how he used Amazon's EC2 and S3 to generate PDF versions of 11 million articles.

> "I then began some rough calculations and determined that if I used only four machines, it could take some time to generate all 11 million article PDFs. But thanks to the swell people at Amazon, I got access to a few more machines and churned through all 11 million articles in just under 24 hours using 100 EC2 instances, and generated another 1.5TB of data to store in S3."
