From this weekend's "Adventures with Tivo," Charlie Rose had [Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and the Coen brothers on](http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2007/11/16/1/a-discussion-about-the-film-no-country-for-old-men) to discuss No Country for Old Men. Worth the time, even though it's, you know, Charlie Rose.
