Thanks for playing, ladies and gentlemen, the official winner of the October 2007 edition of "[the girl on a bike game](http://www.kottke.org/00/07/as-i-was-walking-home)" is [miz_ginevra](http://twitter.com/miz_ginevra/statuses/343352982), who (un)knowingly takes the whole thing full circle.Â  (See, it's like when a stadium does the wave, and it makes it all the way around...oh, never mind.)
