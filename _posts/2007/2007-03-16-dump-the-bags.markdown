A hearty +1 to Dale Dougherty's post [Bag the Schwag](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/bag_the_schwag.html).  In Austin this week all I wanted from the bag was the tiny conference guide that I could fold up and stick in my pocket or inside my badge; the rest of it was just wasted promotional material.  And when I told the bag people this, they were literally shocked.  "You mean you don't want all these magazines?  Look at all these great magazines!"  And then after I convinced them that No, I didn't want the magazines, they told me I _had_ to take at least the full-size program (along with the micro-sized one) because, and I kid you not, "people sell them for thirty bucks on eBay."  The program went back in the bag.  

Other highlights of Austin:  [Henry Jenkins](http://www.henryjenkins.org/); catching up with "easterners" [Bryan Boyer](http://www.bryanboyer.com/), [Molly Steenson](http://www.girlwonder.com/) and the [Hesketh](http://hesketh.com/about/leadership.html) crew; our panel on [After Bust 2.0](http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060111) ("How many of you are here because you're afraid of losing your jobs?"); general twitter mania; having the [mobile web panel](http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060244) I was on scheduled opposite of Will Wright's Spore demo (gah!); contributing to [continuous partial attention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Partial_Attention) by phoning Jason Shellen while Heather Gold was interviewing him about the same; meeting a bunch of great MT, TypePad, Vox and LJ bloggers; and the lightning show on Sunday night.  Wow...a real thunderstorm!  We don't get those out here very often.

And In case you're curious, as of this afternoon there are exactly [zero](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&fkr=1&from=R8&satitle=sxsw&category0=&submitSearch=Search) conference programs for sale on eBay.
