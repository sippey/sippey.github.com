Dave Itzkoff [reviews _Spook Country_](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/books/review/Itzkoff4-t.html):

> What initially unites these seemingly unrelated narratives is a theme familiar to Gibson’s work: the novice initiated into an alternative reality he or she never knew existed. But in each of these strands, Gibson is also playing on the word "spook," not just in the slang sense of a spy, but also in the more traditional sense of a ghost — of figures who pass through the world unnoticed and unrecognized, and who are about to find out how empowering anonymity can be.
