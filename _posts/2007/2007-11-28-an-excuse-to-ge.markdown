<p>As if I needed another excuse for a trip to New York, there's the Puryear exhibition at MoMA.&nbsp; Tyler Green's been doing a series of posts at Modern Art Notes putting Puryear in perspective; <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2007/11/puryear_and_perspective_kelly.html">today's post</a> is about the&nbsp; connection between Puryear's sculpture and minimalist painting. I'm an unabashed fan of minimalism (surprise!) and loved this sentence in Green's post:&nbsp; &quot;Of course to this day Puryear's sculptures are reductive, almost tidy in their banishment of anything even potentially, remotely extraneous.&quot;</p>
