Michael is enjoying his brand new pair of Keen sneakers, which he bought from Zappos.  Michael is enjoying a triple grande latte, which he bought from the Starbucks at the corner of 4th and Brannan. Michael is comfortably clad in a pair of Levi 501 blue jeans, which he bought at the Levi's store in Union Square in San Francisco.  Michael is typing on a 13" white Apple MacBook, which was purchased for him through CDW's remarkable online store.
