So I'm stuck on the BART platform with train delays, and while I could call home to let them know I'm running late, what I would really love is a mounted display in my house that I could send an SMS to. It would be useful for low impact but reasonably time sensitive messages like "BART excitement, big delays" or even just little notes to the kids throughout the day ("Hi, munchkins!").
