[Other Minds](http://www.otherminds.org/), the new music community based in San Francisco and best known for its annual [Other Minds festival](http://www.otherminds.org/shtml/Concerts12.shtml), has launched [radiOM.org](http://radiom.org/), a site that provides streaming audio from their catalog of interviews, lectures and performances.  There's a [1963 interview with John Cage](http://radiom.org/detail.php?et=interview&omid=C.1963.XX.XX), a [1983 interview with Philip Glass](http://radiom.org/detail.php?et=interview&omid=AM.1983.04.18), a [1965 Trombone piece by Pauline Oliveros](http://radiom.org/detail.php?et=music&omid=P.1965.XX.XX) and dozens of other great finds. 

Of particular note is guitarist David Tanenbaum performing [Lou Harrison's _Scenes from Nek Chand_](http://radiom.org/detail.php?et=music&omid=OMF.2002.03.07.03) on a National Steel.  I saw Tanenbaum perform that yesterday at a fund raiser for Other Minds, and it's really something else.
