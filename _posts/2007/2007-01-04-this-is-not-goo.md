Tim Goodman, TV writer and possibly the most compelling reason to read the SF Chronicle, is [threatening to shutter The Bastard Machine](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=24&entry_id=12268), his blog on SFGate.com.Â  "Now that I'm back at work, I'm really, truly going to work on not blogging. So much, I mean. I don't think they'll let me stop. I'm told that's the future." I trust that this is just one of those "blogger phases" that everyone links to but I'm too lazy to Google.
