Was reminded tonight of [Remem](http://www.remem.org/), the Rememberance Agent plugin for emacs.  Bradley Rhodes' original paper was written in 1996; by now this should be a feature of every popular operating system.  Option a: this problem is harder than it looks.  Option b: this is a problem that the market doesn't have.  Option c: this is a problem the market doesn't know it has, until someone comes along and solves it for them in an elegant and intuitive way.  (Did I hear someone say "next gen Google productivity apps?")
