Bloggers have known this for years -- you want to own the Google search results for your name -- and it's nice to hear this thinking finally make its way into the mass media.<br /><br />But really, this is just an excuse to experiment with a new type of news blogging -- taking a quick picture of the story you find while leafing through the morning's paper...instead of going to the trouble finding the story and actually linking to it. Plus, it was a way to sneak Santa Claus on to the blog...so a big "ho ho ho" to all you Christmas celebrators out there.<br clear="all" />
