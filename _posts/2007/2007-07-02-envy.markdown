I have iPhone envy, but not for the email and the calendar; only for the iPod component.  I want the full screen, touch navigation, photo showing piece.  Until they have ActiveSync OTA working (or until I'm no longer tethered to Exchange), the email / calendar / contacts syncing thing won't cut it for me.
