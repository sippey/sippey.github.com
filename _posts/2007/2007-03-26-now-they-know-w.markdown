Today was my first day with the new EZ Rider BART card.&nbsp; No more paper tickets, no more fumbling with the world's most unusable UI when I have to refill said paper tickets, no more wondering if there's enough value on said paper ticket to make it home.&nbsp; Instead, an RFID-enabled card linked to an appropriate credit institution which is swiped on entry and exit.&nbsp; The combination of this and the FasTrak-enabled automobiles means that The Man will know where I am, but it's not as if my route between <a href="http://www.bart.gov/stations/stationGuide/stationOverview_NBRK.asp">North Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://www.bart.gov/stations/stationGuide/stationOverview_POWEL.asp">Powell</a> is much of a secret...</p>

<p>Insanely jealous BART rider?&nbsp; The program's currently in pilot; <a href="http://www.bart.gov/news/features/features20061018.asp">apply today</a>.</p>
