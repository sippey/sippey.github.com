[![Ezrider_rotate](https://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/images/2007/03/26/ezrider_rotate.gif "Ezrider_rotate")](http://sippey.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/03/26/ezrider_rotate.gif) Today was my first day with the new EZ Rider BART card.  No more paper tickets, no more fumbling with the world's most unusable UI when I have to refill said paper tickets, no more wondering if there's enough value on said paper ticket to make it home.  Instead, an RFID-enabled card linked to an appropriate credit institution which is swiped on entry and exit.  The combination of this and the FasTrak-enabled automobiles means that The Man will know where I am, but it's not as if my route between [North Berkeley](http://www.bart.gov/stations/stationGuide/stationOverview_NBRK.asp) and [Powell](http://www.bart.gov/stations/stationGuide/stationOverview_POWEL.asp) is much of a secret...

Insanely jealous BART rider?  The program's currently in pilot; [apply today](http://www.bart.gov/news/features/features20061018.asp).
