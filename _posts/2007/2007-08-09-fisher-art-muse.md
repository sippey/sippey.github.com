Kenneth Baker on [the possibility of a Fisher collection museum](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/08/MN88RES742.DTL&hw=donald+fisher&sn=002&sc=982) in San Francisco's Presidio.Â  "on Tuesday, Donald Fisher said that to have given SFMOMA their collection would have burdened the museum with unbearable pressures of storage, conservation and display. The facility the Fishers propose would have more exhibition space than SFMOMA as a whole contains." _(Holy shit.)_
