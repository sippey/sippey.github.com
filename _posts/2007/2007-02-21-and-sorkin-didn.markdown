So there's apparently an [indeterminate future for Aaron Sorkin's _Studio 60_](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/02/19/DDGDFO5N2Q1.DTL), where "indeterminate" means that the show most likely won't get renewed for next year, and it's currently unclear whether NBC will even air the remaining episodes. (Yes, the ratings have been _that bad_, and the show reportedly costs more than $3mm an episode to produce.)  Tim Goodman (linked above) does a good job outlining the problems with the show (a flawed premise, a show about comedy that wasn't funny, a series of bad casting decisions), but  I have to give props to [Hugin on the Television Without Pity forums](http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?s=&showtopic=3143647&view=findpost&p=7200468) for his take...

> If you launch with an extended Network-esque rant about the state of TV (including actual namechecks of Paddy Chayevsky), then proceed to repeatedly declare your main characters brilliant saviors, then go on several extended riffs on your disdain for reality TV and every small mind that slighted you, the writer, in your professional career, make dozens of pedantic (if not always actually correct) references to drive home just how smart everyone is, and generally dump a steaming truckload of hubris on your show's front yard and then plant your flag, then _you'd better fucking bring it._

I'm hoping Sorkin finds another TV vehicle soon, lest our national broadcast airwaves go without their recommended weekly allowance of  [pediconferencing](http://www.google.com/search?q=pediconferencing).
