<p>So Stars has a <a href="http://www.arts-crafts.ca/releases_spotlight.php?search=AC028">new album</a> coming out in September, but it's <a href="http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fid%253D259166019%2526s%253D143441">already available</a> @ the iTunes music store.&nbsp; This in itself is bloggable, but the thing that makes it esp bloggable is the fantastic title of track 12, &quot;Today Will Be Better, I Swear!&quot;</p>
