So Stars has a [new album](http://www.arts-crafts.ca/releases_spotlight.php?search=AC028) coming out in September, but it's [already available](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253Fid%253D259166019%2526s%253D143441) @ the iTunes music store.Â  This in itself is bloggable, but the thing that makes it esp bloggable is the fantastic title of track 12, "Today Will Be Better, I Swear!"
