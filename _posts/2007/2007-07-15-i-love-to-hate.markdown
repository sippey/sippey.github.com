<p>From the best of Craigslist, <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/ott/363794217.html">Facebook: I love to hate you</a>.&nbsp; &quot;First of all, you allow people from high school that I've never even
spoken to add me as their friend. I dont know them other than the fact
that we were apparently in the same homeroom together in grade 9 before
I got the braces off. Its creepy that they remember the overalls and
the plaid raincoat I was wearing the first day of high school. Please
do not allow these people to seek me out.&quot;</p>
