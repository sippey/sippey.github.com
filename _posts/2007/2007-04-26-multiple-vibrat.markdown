I think Charlie Schick has Twittered about this, but as I get more and more SMS traffic, it would be great if my phone supported multiple vibrate patterns, a la ringtones.  (I always have my phone on vibrate, because in I have an impossible time actually hearing my phone ring.  Either I'm getting older (speak up, sonny) or I'm deliberately ignoring incoming calls.)

Here's what I want.

*   Bzzt == twitter or other automated SMS.
*   Bzzt bzzt == SMS from an actual human.
*   Bzzt bzzt bzzt == phone call.
*   Special pattern of bzzt's == phone call from someone special

Couldn't be that hard, could it?
