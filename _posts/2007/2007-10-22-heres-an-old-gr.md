From Stating the Obvious, February 1997: [The Network Diagram](http://www.theobvious.com/network/).Â  "I've abandoned link list. In its place I've drawn this simple diagram, a roadmap to the self-absorbed world of Internet publishing. Six degrees of separation? Ha. Try two at the most."

Extra credit for identifying the publications that still exist.
