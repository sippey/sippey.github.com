Slate's Mickey Kaus on the [cop out](http://www.slate.com/id/2178626/) of covering candidate "electability."

> "Who's electable" is a Neutral Story Line--it seemingly doesn't require reporters and publications to take stands or sides. You can write dozens of "Is Hillary Electable?" stories without letting on what you think about, say, government-guaranteed health care. It's harder to write "Will Hillary be a Good President?" without doing that.
