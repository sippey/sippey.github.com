6Aer Kevin Goess writes a [brilliant post](http://keving.vox.com/library/post/ferry-park-20-years-gone.html) summing up how the San Francisco Department of Parks and Recreation is killing a twenty year tradition of volleyball in Ferry Park. (Never heard of Ferry Park? It's near the Ferry Building.) "Why should you care? Why should anyone who doesn't like to play volleyball care? Because having a stable, dependable presence in a neighborhood that is otherwise deserted after 6:00pm is a Good Thing."
