patterns, or splashes of paint like Rorschach patterns — tested a
viewer’s psychological and visual flexibility. See a line. See that it
can be straight, thin, broken, curved, soft, angled or thick. Enjoy the
differences. The test was not hard to pass if your eyes and mind were
open, which was the message of Mr. LeWitt’s art.</p></blockquote><p>LeWitt, probably more than anyone else, changed the way I thought about art.&nbsp; A spit bite aquatint of his from <a href="http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/lewitt/index.html">Crown Point Press</a> was a gift from my wife back when we first started dating; it's one of the most cherished things in our home.</p>
