Events galore. Last night was at the [Creative Commons mixer in SF](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7716), where we demo'd a new [CC licensing widget](http://everything.typepad.com/cc/) we've built for TypePad (everything.typepad.com blog post coming soon) and presented to CC a check for $15,000+ that was raised by the LiveJournal community as part of this summer's [permanent account sale](http://news.livejournal.com/100876.html). Tonight I'll be at the Silicon Valley American Marketing Association's [event on Marketing 2.0](http://www.svama.net/events/20071011mpreg.html) in Cupertino, on a panel talking about...wait for it...blogging! That makes it a "circle the Bay" day (Berkeley --> SF --> South Bay --> Berkeley), which means at some point there will be [prog rock](http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/2007/10/another-brick.html) on in the car.
