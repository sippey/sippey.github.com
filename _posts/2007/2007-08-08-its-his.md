George Vecsey [in the New York Times](http://select.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/sports/baseball/08vecsey.html?_r=1) _(behind the Select paywall; isn't that going away?)_ on Barry Bonds hitting number 756.

> It’s his record. What is baseball going to do, come up with some magic formula to pare down his home run totals? They are all his, every one of them. Victor Conte of notorious Balco didn’t hit them. Greg Anderson, the trainer guarding Bonds’s secrets in a California jail, didn’t hit them. The people who made money off Bonds and the union officials who blocked testing didn’t hit the home runs. Barry Bonds hit them, all 756 of them.
