<p>Justin Davidson (standing in for Alex Ross) <a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/2007/03/mtt_speaks_so_w.html">covers</a> the upcoming American Public Media radio show, <a href="http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/programs/mtt_files/">The MTT Files</a>.&nbsp; (Where MTT = Michael Tilson Thomas.)</p><blockquote><p>Rather than leading listeners on a dutiful trudge through history,
MTT tells stories of the “I remember when Stravinsky told me...”
variety. Like any accomplished raconteur, he has buffed each memory to
a blinding sheen of significance, poignancy, or wry humor — or all
three. He has a well-stocked storehouse of anecdotes, but if I can
recognize some of them from the half a dozen hours I have spent
interviewing him over the course of ten years, I suspect his close
friends have his stories cataloged and numbered by now.</p></blockquote><p>I once had the pleasure of seeing MTT do an intro talk to John Adams' Harmoniliehre...he's an incredible speaker / storyteller, so I'm really looking forward to this show.<br /> </p>
