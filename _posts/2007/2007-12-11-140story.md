I really like what Joshua Rothhaas (from [kindofdelicious](http://kindofdelicious.blogspot.com/)) is doing at [twitter.com/140story](http://twitter.com/140story), where every tweet is a story written in 140 characters or less. He doesn't connect on every one, but he'd have a decent major-league batting average. Here are a few of my favorites:

> Avid mountain climber, venture capitalist and daredevil, he had but one fear in this world: love, because "only a real man can be a lover."
> 
> Two design students fall madly in love and make terribly bold statements holding each other to be more perfect than the typeface Helvetica.  
> 
> Nation wide protest lead to state wide crackdowns lead to city wide arrest and to local activism which gave way to powerful personal apathy.
