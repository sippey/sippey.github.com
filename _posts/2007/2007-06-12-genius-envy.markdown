<p><strong>In the go-go days of the '80s art
</strong></p>

<p><strong>market, it seemed as if any old
</strong></p>

<p><strong>stockbroker with a creative
</strong></p>

<p><strong>streak and a penchant for
</strong></p>

<p><strong>self-promotion could have been
</strong></p>

<p><strong>crowned &quot;King Midas of SoHo.&quot; In
</strong></p>

<p><strong>fact, one of them was. Back in,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>say, 1983, when Saturday
</strong></p>

<p><strong>afternoon gallery strollers
</strong></p>

<p><strong>encountered a ready-made,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>plexiglass-encased vacuum
</strong></p>

<p><strong>cleaner courtesy of Jeff Koons,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>they usually had the same,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>amazed, open-mouthed reaction: 

</strong></p>

<pre><strong>&nbsp;</strong></pre>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.suck.com/daily/96/09/24/daily.html" name="2"></a>

</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I could have done that.&quot;

<p><strong>Unlike <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.suck.com/zerobaud/96/08/22/">Warhol</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.artn.nwu.edu/Early/plate.html">Duchamp</a> before

<p><strong>him, Koons wasn't out to infuse
</strong></p>

<p><strong>everyday objects like soup cans
</strong></p>

<p><strong>and blonde movie stars with
</strong></p>

<p><strong>extraordinary meaning. Instead,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Koons was interested in
</strong></p>

<p><strong>eliminating meaning - parodying
</strong></p>

<p><strong>shiny things by making them even
</strong></p>

<p><strong>shinier. By proclaiming himself
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the &quot;most written-about artist
</strong></p>

<p><strong>in the world,&quot; Koons became the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>ultimate art world parodist.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only by crowning himself King of
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pop could he skewer the other
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.broadartfdn.org/c12.Koons.html">King of Pop</a>.

<p><strong>More than a decade on, today's
</strong></p>

<p><strong>parodists <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.suck.com/zerobaud/96/05/16/">know</a> that those who
</strong></p>

<p><strong>can, do, while those who can't,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>redo. Still, they must ache for
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the life that Koons enjoyed -
</strong></p>

<p><strong>wine-soaked gallery openings,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>ArtForum covers, an Italian porn
</strong></p>

<p><strong>star for a wife. But, since the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>bottom fell out of the art
</strong></p>

<p><strong>market just around, say, October
</strong></p>

<p><strong>1987, the parodists of today
</strong></p>

<p><strong>can't hope to enjoy Koons-like
</strong></p>

<p><strong>riches. Instead, they're stuck
</strong></p>

<p><strong>with nonprofit art spaces -
</strong></p>

<p><strong>where society types masquerade
</strong></p>

<p><strong>as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.genart.org/">curators</a> - or the web. Thanks
</strong></p>

<p><strong>to the brass ring of press
</strong></p>

<p><strong>coverage and ad banners, most
</strong></p>

<p><strong>choose the latter.

</strong></p>

<p><strong>These days it's easy for a young,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>budding parodist to get hooked
</strong></p>

<p><strong>on the illicit thrill of digital
</strong></p>

<p><strong>caricature. Combine a need to
</strong></p>

<p><strong>blow off some work-induced
</strong></p>

<p><strong>stress with the common desire to
</strong></p>

<p><strong>surf a bastardized version of
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the corporate web site, and boom -
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.ua.com/games/zippy/">Zippy the Pinhead</a> active
</strong></p>

<p><strong>filter appears. It's the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>equivalent of that first hit of
</strong></p>

<p><strong>reefer for the kid in the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>schoolyard. It's safe, it's
</strong></p>

<p><strong>easy, and if their hand eye
</strong></p>

<p><strong>coordination is good enough,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alt-Tabbing away when the boss
</strong></p>

<p><strong>walks by will be just as natural
</strong></p>

<p><strong>as palming the smoking joint
</strong></p>

<p><strong>when the wrestling coach spotted
</strong></p>

<p><strong>them behind the high school gym.

<p><strong>Eventually, they'll turn to
</strong></p>

<p><strong>stronger stuff and need to steal
</strong></p>

<p><strong>to support their habit. The
</strong></p>

<p><strong>standard web browser's View

<p><strong>Source command is the Saturday
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Night Special of the web. Sure,
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.links.net/webpub/">HTML is easy as hell</a>, but
</strong></p>

<p><strong>outright robbery is a hell of a

<p><strong>lot easier. Armed with a

<p><strong>browser, all one needs to
</strong></p>

<p><strong>jumpstart a web counterfeiting

<p><strong>career is some free time and a

<p><strong>web server.

<p><strong>name. Case in point: everyone's
</strong></p>

<p><strong>favorite web whipping post,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Slate, spawned two ripoffs, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.stale.com/">Stale</a> and
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://c3f.com/stall/">Stall</a>. Both swiped layout and
</strong></p>

<p><strong>images. Both took cheap shots at
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the khakied ones from the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>northwest. But Stale had the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>$100 for &quot;stale.com,&quot; and won
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the publicity contest hands
</strong></p>

<p><strong>down.

<p><strong>Sure, your mother told you never
</strong></p>

<p><strong>to judge a book by its cover.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>But on the web, image is
</strong></p>

<p><strong>everything. If the game were
</strong></p>

<p><strong>based on what's actually beyond
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the URL, Stall would be the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>obvious nominee for the Parody
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pulitzer. In the book review
</strong></p>

<p><strong>category, Stall's review of
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://c3f.com/stall/boo.html">Kathy Acker, My Mother</a>, where
</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;250 pages of the book are
</strong></p>

<p><strong>blank&quot; smartly appeals to the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>postliterate in all of us.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stale, on the other hand, tries
</strong></p>

<p><strong>to combine the worst of a
</strong></p>

<p><strong>decade-old Wendy's ad with Upton
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sinclair in &quot;Where's the Beef,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inspector?&quot; Nevertheless, Stale
</strong></p>

<p><strong>wins the ad banners, while Stall
</strong></p>

<p><strong>languishes with obscure-joke
</strong></p>

<p><strong>banners.

<p><strong>Stale better watch their back,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>because sometimes the grandest
</strong></p>

<p><strong>plans of a parodist backfire.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>After all, who's not to say that
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stall couldn't reinvent itself
</strong></p>

<p><strong>as a parody of Stale? The more
</strong></p>

<p><strong>likely scenario, however, is
</strong></p>

<p><strong>that the &quot;Oprah syndrome&quot; takes
</strong></p>

<p><strong>over, and the cult of the victim
</strong></p>

<p><strong>(in this case, Kinsley) grows
</strong></p>

<p><strong>over time. In New York, a
</strong></p>

<p><strong>mediocre subway mugging
</strong></p>

<p><strong>transformed an ordinary commuter
</strong></p>

<p><strong>into the &quot;legendary&quot; Bernard
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Goetz. On the web, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.thesquat.com/">The

</strong></p>

<p><strong>from just another Southern
</strong></p>

<p><strong>California soap opera to Cool

<p><strong>Site of the Year. If Microsoft
</strong></p>

<p><strong>were smart, it would acquire
</strong></p>

<p><strong>both Stale and Stall, set up
</strong></p>

<p><strong>alternate production staffs, and
</strong></p>

<p><strong>reap the ad revenue from all

<p><strong>three.

<p><strong>Don't laugh - metaparody's been
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.displacing.com/">done</a>. Some of the web's more
</strong></p>

<p><strong>jaundiced parodists have found
</strong></p>

<p><strong>that the thrill of vandalizing
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the unsuspecting mark dulls
</strong></p>

<p><strong>after a while, and instead turn
</strong></p>

<p><strong>sights on themselves. On the one
</strong></p>

<p><strong>hand, it's a way of keeping one
</strong></p>

<p><strong>step ahead of the pack, of
</strong></p>

<p><strong>outparodying the parodists. On
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the other hand, or <em>with</em> the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>other hand, it's a bit
</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010712085218/http://www.theobvious.com/harder/">autoerotic</a>. Sure, it may feel

<p><strong>you'll just go blind.

<p><strong>It used to be that high-profile
</strong></p>

<p><strong>crimes required high-profile
</strong></p>

<p><strong>tools - automatic weapons,
</strong></p>

<p><strong>getaway cars, Swiss bank
</strong></p>

<p><strong>accounts - and thus limited the
</strong></p>

<p><strong>number of people that could
</strong></p>

<p><strong>actually pull them off. But on
</strong></p>

<p><strong>the web, with such easy access
</strong></p>

<p><strong>to the weapons of choice -
</strong></p>

<p><strong>browsers, text editors, Paint
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shop Pro - the work of the Way
