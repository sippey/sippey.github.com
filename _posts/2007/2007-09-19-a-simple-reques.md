Dear Lazyweb. Please produce a detailed comparison (with screenshots, please!) of [Mint](http://www.mint.com/) and [Wesabe](http://www.wesabe.com/). It's about time I channel my (former) inner-Quicken-user to the web, and I don't have the time / patience to try both of them. (Well, actually, I did have time to attempt Mint yesterday afternoon, but their [Yodlee](http://corporate.yodlee.com/) connector must have been overwhelmed with new users because connections to my external accounts timed out and they told me to try again later.)
