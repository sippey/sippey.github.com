[Michiko Kakutani on _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows_](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/books/19potter.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1184829495-0Qz3hiVKrfiik1/Fijd6cg "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling - Books - Review - New York Times"):

> True to its roots, \[the book\] ends not with modernist, “Soprano”-esque equivocation, but with good old-fashioned closure: a big-screen, heart-racing, bone-chilling confrontation and an epilogue that clearly lays out people’s fates.

Can you imagine if Rowling _had_ actually done a "modernist, Soprano-esque" ending?  She'd be run out of town by a ten million-strong angry mob of ten year olds screaming "WHAT DO WE WANT? CLOSURE! WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW!"
