The [spinning lady](http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22556281-661,00.html) that is supposed to tell you if you're more right-brained or left-brained just makes my brain hurt. She was spinning counter-clockwise for a long time, and I tried to look away based on [Kottke's advice](http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/10/14270.html), but just got distsracted by the ads. But after coming back to the browser tab after a couple hours, now she's spinning clockwise, and I can't make her stop. Damn you, spinning lady! How am I supposed to categorize myself into one of two buckets?
