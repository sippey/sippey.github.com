Here's an out-there-on-a-limb tech prediction where I'd be happy to be proven wrong: **Apple will not announce a tablet on January 26th.**

You see, I really just ghost blog for [David](http://hello.typepad.com/), who makes a compelling case (i.e. he said it over IM) that it will "just" be a MacBook with a touchscreen. To which I unimaginatively added a fold around hinge like the tablet PCs, but where you can use your fingers instead of a special pen. Oh, and some nice content distribution deals and a new packaging format for magazine-style content, a la iTunes albums. Seriously, though, I'd be very happy to be proven wrong on this.
