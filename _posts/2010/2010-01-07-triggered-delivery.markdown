Just got the receipt email for my digital pre-order of Daniel Suarez's [_Freedom (TM)_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951571?ie=UTF8&tag=statingtheobviou&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0525951571) (the follow up to _Daemon_), which means that as I type this sentence the novel's making its way to my Kindle in the other room. Automatically.

If you've read _Daemon_, you'll understand the irony in this.
