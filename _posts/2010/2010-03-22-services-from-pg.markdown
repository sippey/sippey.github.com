> "We're active in franchising now with Mr. Clean car washes and Tide Dry Cleaners. MDVIP \[concierge physician service\] is a service operation. But we're also working on services on our existing brands, for example, where you walk up to the shelf, take a picture of the UPC code on your phone, and you can download information about the ingredients in that product, which you as an environmentalist may care about."

Great piece in AdAge about P&G's move into service-oriented business, which is partly driven by the law of large numbers. "Every percentage point of growth now requires about $800 million new sales."
