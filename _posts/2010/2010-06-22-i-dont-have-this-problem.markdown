Dave Pell laments his slip from dealer to user, and confesses his addiction to the streaming realtime app-enabled social media hoo ha, since he's doing things like checking his iPhone every five minutes and avoiding his children and tweeting while driving, etc., etc.

I don't have this problem. Sure, I'm as addicted to the streaming realtime app-enabled social media hoo ha. But I don't have the guilt of slipping from a dealer to a user. I've always been a user...so now being a dealer as well and having access to my own supply now only makes things easier.
