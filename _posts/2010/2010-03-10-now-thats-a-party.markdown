<p>I loved this little bit from The March 1 New Yorker profile of Paul Krugman: "Once, he and [his wife] Wells gave a Halloween party where the theme was economics topics -- two guests came as Asian tigers, several came as hedge funds, one woman came as capital, dressed up as a column."</p>

<p>That's right: two Asian tigers. Imagine the awkwardness. </p>
