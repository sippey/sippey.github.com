I loved this little bit from The March 1 New Yorker profile of Paul Krugman: "Once, he and \[his wife\] Wells gave a Halloween party where the theme was economics topics -- two guests came as Asian tigers, several came as hedge funds, one woman came as capital, dressed up as a column."

That's right: two Asian tigers. Imagine the awkwardness.
