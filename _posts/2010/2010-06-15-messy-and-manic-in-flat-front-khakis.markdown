<p>Highly recommended:  <a href="http://amzn.to/apK9GL">Jamie Lidell's <em>Compass</em></a>.  Pitchfork only <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14273-compass/">gave it a 6.6</a> (really? not a 6.7?) But the bits that they found worthy of criticism are what I think make it his most interesting record yet...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compass isn't another sweeping re-invention of Lidell's sound, nor is it even really a particularly cohesive collection of songs. It is, instead, a messy and manic record, one that's more concerned with the moment than with any overarching aesthetic or tone. </p>

<p>Up with messy, manic and concerns of the moment.  Here's the video for track six, <em>The Ring</em>.</p>

<p>You may also enjoy the video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgM_V1j6CoI">I Wanna Be Your Telephone</a>, which features Lidell in flat-front khakis. It's my favorite song on the record.</p>
