Great post from David Hornik [at VentureBlog](http://ventureblog.com/articles/2010/01/facebook_twitter_and_pg.php) after spending time with Procter & Gamble at their "Innovation Outreach Venturing Day."

> To P&G, Twitter is a great broadcast medium -- it is best for one to many communications that are short bursts of timely information -- but as good as it is for timely information, the P&G folks do not view it as particularly relevant to what they are doing on the brand building and advertising side. For those things that Proctor & Gamble thinks are most interesting and important, they do not believe that Twitter will ever approach the value they can get out of a Google or Facebook.

Worth reading in full.
