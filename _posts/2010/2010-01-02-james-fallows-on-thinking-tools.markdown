James Fallows is a fantastic blogger, and has a history of doing great reviews of software "thinking tools" like outliners and Ecco and The Brain, etc. He's back on the thinking tools warpath [these past few days](http://jamesfallows.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/more_on_grandview_thinklinkr_a.php); pointing folks to [Thinklinkr](http://thinklinkr.com/) (a web-based collaborative outliner) and digging up some screenshots of GrandView, the DOS product that "many buffs consider...the best outliner ever invented.

Call it a new year's fetish, but I'm trying to get back into thinking tools. And it's depressing, because leaving aside the slew of [everything buckets](http://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html) out there (all falling into the two- or three-paned note taking metaphor), there really hasn't been much advancement in tools that help you capture, organize and interlink random bits of data since, well, [The Brain](http://www.thebrain.com/). Or am I missing something?
