I will not be in Austin this year, though the inimitable Paul Ford will be. You should find him and say hello.

> I've never been to SxSW before. It surprises some people when I tell them that. It also surprises people when I cry or vomit, or get into bed with them well after all the other guests have gone home. But I've never had a job where they want to spend money to send me places to learn things. I think that's a very NYC thing; ideas and talent are supposed to come to _us_, preferably kneeling and begging, not the other way around. This approach is why the finance and publishing industries are enjoying such great years.
