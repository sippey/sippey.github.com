Via [@themexican](http://twitter.com/themexican) comes this [nugget](http://twitter.com/liabulaong/status/10604770253) from [@liabulong](http://twitter.com/liabulaong):

PS: Turns out that the phrase "herbivorous rage" isn't quite the Google whack you'd think it is. As of this morning there are already [319 results](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=safari&rls=en&q=%22herbivorous+rage%22&btnG=Search&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=) (many of which are about the Chronicle's story), including a link spam page regarding "[Vicodin Side Effects](http://community.westcoastsurfmag.com/_Vicodin-Side-Effects/blog/2018209/2885.html)."

The more you know!
