Amazing [comment/post on Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/88018/Gallagher#2889067) from [Dave Green](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1261989/) (aka [turducken](http://www.metafilter.com/user/40099)), the writer / director of the documentary _[History of the Joke](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt1187004/)_, about Gallagher.

> The stuff I find most fascinating is Gallagher's interaction with his audience -- e..g, his genuine desire to set kids on the straight and narrow, his put-downs of hecklers, and his seemingly Job-like ability to endure physical and psychic humiliations that would cow or creep out most open-mike punters -- which IMO has nothing to do with comedy, and has everything to do with being a 63-year old guy with several ex-wives, grown children, and a heart attack under his belt who can't stop working, and is terrified of what happens when he does.

And if you haven't read it, his [interview with The Onion's AV Club](http://www.avclub.com/articles/gallagher,36622/) is remarkable. Here he is responding to a question about how he's interrupted his opening acts to give them advice on how to perform.

> They don’t pay attention to what they’re wearing or how they’re standing. And so we don’t really have a high level of performance in America, or even a demand that people onstage have studied, or pay attention to the performing arts. You can actually take a drink now during your show! You know, George Burns performed smoking a cigar, and never needed a drink of water on a stool. But now this has become a tradition in America. They more or less have a stool ready for you and ask, “What water ya want?” To me, as a visual artist, everything that’s in the picture should have meaning—what does a stool and a bottle of water _mean_?

Emphasis his.
