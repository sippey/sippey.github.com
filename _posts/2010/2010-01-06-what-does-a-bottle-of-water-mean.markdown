<p>Amazing <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/88018/Gallagher#2889067">comment/post on Metafilter</a> from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1261989/">Dave Green</a> (aka <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/40099">turducken</a>), the writer / director of the documentary <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt1187004/">History of the Joke</a></em>, about Gallagher.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The stuff I find most fascinating is Gallagher's interaction with his audience -- e..g, his genuine desire to set kids on the straight and narrow, his put-downs of hecklers, and his seemingly Job-like ability to endure physical and psychic humiliations that would cow or creep out most open-mike punters -- which IMO has nothing to do with comedy, and has everything to do with being a 63-year old guy with several ex-wives, grown children, and a heart attack under his belt who can't stop working, and is terrified of what happens when he does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you haven't read it, his <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/gallagher,36622/">interview with The Onion's AV Club</a> is remarkable. Here he is responding to a question about how he's interrupted his opening acts to give them advice on how to perform.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They don’t pay attention to what they’re wearing or how they’re standing. And so we don’t really have a high level of performance in America, or even a demand that people onstage have studied, or pay attention to the performing arts. You can actually take a drink now during your show! You know, George Burns performed smoking a cigar, and never needed a drink of water on a stool. But now this has become a tradition in America. They more or less have a stool ready for you and ask, “What water ya want?” To me, as a visual artist, everything that’s in the picture should have meaning—what does a stool and a bottle of water <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p>Emphasis his.</p>
