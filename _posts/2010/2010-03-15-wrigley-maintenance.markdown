If you're a Cubs fan...or just a fan of Wrigley Field, you'll appreciate this: Everyblock's Daniel X. O'Neil went [digging through the city permits](http://www.derivativeworks.com/2010/03/wrigley-field-work-new-banners-out-front-refreshed-scoreboard-new-billboard-in-left-field-batting-ca.html) for all the work that's happening on the stadium in prep for baseball season. On deck: new promotional signage on the outside of the stadium, some scoreboard repairs, a new sign in left field, an improved batting cage, an improved umpire dressing room and more capacity in the women's restrooms.
