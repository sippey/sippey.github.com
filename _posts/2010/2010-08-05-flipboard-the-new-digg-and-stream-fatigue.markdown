<p>I&#39;ve been enjoying <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/" target="_self">Flipboard</a> the past few days: the design is engaging, the flipping animation addictive, and their content channels are well-packaged.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature, of course, is the social aggregation. &#0160;Flipboard isn&#39;t the most efficient way to catch up on Twitter and Facebook, but flipping through what my friends are posting and linking to is fun. And maybe it&#39;s a function of the people I&#39;m following, but the pages the app generates are sometimes just plain weird. &#0160;In a good way. &#0160;Like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef013485ff675a970c-pi"><img alt="Flipboard-2" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef013485ff675a970c-500wi" /></a></p>
<p>Ah...some sort of moldy cheesebread from a woman wearing black lipstick...and a story about Vic Gundotra, together at last. Outcomes like this are what make Flipboard such a gutsy product: &#0160;people are messy, their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_self">social</a>/<a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_self">interest</a> graphs are messy, and algorithmically forcing the flat stream of posts into a hierarchical magazine-style layout is bound to produce some odd results.</p>
<p>Now compare Flipboard to the new Digg.</p>
<p><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef013485ff6c4b970c-pi"><img alt="New-digg" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef013485ff6c4b970c-500wi" /></a></p>
<p>Digg may have a ton more going on behind the scenes re. content distribution, community-based filtering, social-filtering etc...and all those algorithms may produce a more effective newsfeed. But it doesn&#39;t feel half as fun. It feels like work. And engaging with media shouldn&#39;t feel like work.</p>
<p>Flipboard&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_up" target="_self">cut up machine</a> as social news reader may not work as a mass product. And Flipboard will likely tune their algorithms to make the pages seem a little less random (though I personally hope not). But their magazine-style layout, coupled with the iPad form factor, has afforded them the opportunity to create something compelling.</p>
