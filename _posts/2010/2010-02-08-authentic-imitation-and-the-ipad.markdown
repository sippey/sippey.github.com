Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/10/02/authentic-imitation) comes info about [deckle edges](http://www.themillions.com/2010/02/deckle-edge-in-the-age-of-mechanical-reproduction.html), the imitation in modern books of what sliced pages would look like. Which makes me wonder just why the iPad -- with its faux bookshelf and its faux page turn isn't going all the way to having the user cut the edge of the virtual page with a virtual knife before being able to turn it.
