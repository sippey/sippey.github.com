<p>Via <a href="http://kottke.org/10/02/authentic-imitation">Kottke</a> comes info about <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2010/02/deckle-edge-in-the-age-of-mechanical-reproduction.html">deckle edges</a>, the imitation in modern books of what sliced pages would look like. Which makes me wonder just why the iPad -- with its faux bookshelf and its faux page turn isn&#39;t going all the way to having the user cut the edge of the virtual page with a virtual knife before being able to turn it.</p>
