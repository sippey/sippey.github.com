Instead of boring everyone here to tears with LOST stuff for the next few months, I started a flashsideways blog -- [FAKELOCKE.COM](http://www.fakelocke.com/) \-\- and invited some fellow LOST fans (so far: [David Jacobs](http://hello.typepad.com/), [Tiff Chow](http://tiffchow.typepad.com/), [Ben Trott](http://ben.stupidfool.org) and [Mike Monteiro](http://mikemonteiro.com/)) to contribute meaningless trivia re. season six. Consider it chock full of spoilers (real fans watch); subscribe at will and let me know if you want to participate.
