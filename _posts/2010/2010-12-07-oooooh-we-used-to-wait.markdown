<p>I heard <em>Tiny Furniture</em> superwoman <a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131761926/lena-dunham-s-big-dreams-rest-on-tiny-furniture" target="_self">Lena Dunham on Terry Gross</a> last night on the ride home, and I enjoyed this bit of the interview, where they&#39;re talking about Dunham reading her mother&#39;s diaries from the &#39;70s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GROSS: Were there generational differences that you saw between what she experienced as a young woman in the &#39;70s and what you were experiencing, you know, recently?</p>
<p>Ms. DUNHAM: I think a really fascinating thing to me was the lack of social networking because the fact that she would say, you know, like, and, you know, random boyfriend X didn&#39;t call me today. I&#39;m going to have to walk to 14th Street and knock on his door.</p>
<p>And, you know, there was no way to sort of, like, poke someone on the Facebook or send them a text message. Or she&#39;s, like, you know, I&#39;m supposed to see my best friend Jane this afternoon. So I guess I&#39;ll swing by where she works and see if she&#39;s on this afternoon. That kind of real engagement with other people, it was so kind of crazy for me to realize how much of my life is sort of mediated by these technologies that weren&#39;t even a twinkle in her eye.</p>
