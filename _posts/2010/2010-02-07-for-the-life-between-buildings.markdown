City of Sound's Dan Hill has a [long, thoughtful piece on the iPad](http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2010/02/a-machine-for-the-life-between-buildings-some-notes-on-the-ipad.html). There's much worth quoting; I'll just snip this little bit:

> As software becomes a service, data resides in the cloud, various forms of wireless connectivity coalesce over the city, and yet face-to-face physical connection becomes more important than ever, a device like the iPad becomes obvious. The cloud is the connective tissue between these spaces, the software provides the platform for interaction with information, the tablet is the tool, and the forum is the city.

Go read (or Instapaper if you must) the whole thing. (And art geeks will appreciate the "Apologies to Bill Viola" bit.)
