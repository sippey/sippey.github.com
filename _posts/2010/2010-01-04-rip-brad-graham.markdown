His August 8, 2000 post, [Disappointment](http://www.bradlands.com/dailybrad/disappointment/):

> Is there anything more disappointing and frustrating than having driven a great distance to a drive-through fast food restaurant, ordered, paid for and received your lunch, then made a return trip to your office, only to discover that your requested condiment -- the very horseradish sauce that defines the sandwich experience -- was not included in the sack? (Aside from the betrayal by a lover or global war and strife, I mean.)

Yes. [Yes there is](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/18657/Remembering-our-friend-Brad).
