<p>His August 8, 2000 post, <a href="http://www.bradlands.com/dailybrad/disappointment/">Disappointment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there anything more disappointing and frustrating than having driven a great distance to a drive-through fast food restaurant, ordered, paid for and received your lunch, then made a return trip to your office, only to discover that your requested condiment -- the very horseradish sauce that defines the sandwich experience -- was not included in the sack? (Aside from the betrayal by a lover or global war and strife, I mean.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/18657/Remembering-our-friend-Brad">Yes there is</a>.</p>
