El Ten Eleven is going [direct to their fans](http://www.elteneleven.com/north/?p=275) (kickstarter + topspin style\[1\]) to raise funds to finish their forthcoming record. Suggested donations start at $30 and go to $750...

> For $750 – You get a Signed copy of “It’s Still Like A Secret,” executive producer credit on the album artwork and an hour-long helicopter flight with Kristian in Los Angeles (includes lunch). Yes, Kristian is a pilot.

\[1\] Small k, small t on purpose.
