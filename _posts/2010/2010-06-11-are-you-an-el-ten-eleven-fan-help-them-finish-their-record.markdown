<p>El Ten Eleven is going <a href="http://www.elteneleven.com/north/?p=275">direct to their fans</a> (kickstarter + topspin style[1]) to raise funds to finish their forthcoming record. Suggested donations start at $30 and go to $750...</p>

<blockquote><p>For $750 – You get a Signed copy of “It’s Still Like A Secret,” executive producer credit on the album artwork and an hour-long helicopter flight with Kristian in Los Angeles (includes lunch). Yes, Kristian is a pilot.</p></blockquote>
