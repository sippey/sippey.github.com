I'll confess that I was sort of looking forward to Peter Gabriel's album of covers. [Fluxblog's Matthew Perpetua tears it apart](http://www.fluxblog.org/2010/02/the-strain-i-am-under). When Perpetua loves something he lets you know...and when he hates something, well, you get gems like this:

> Peter Gabrielâ€™s new album of covers, Scratch My Back, is one of the most mesmerizingly awful records I have ever encountered. It is terrible in a way that seems unique and special; hideous in a way that is possibly quite profound. His selection of material is fine, but his execution is horrendous, to the point of obliterating the appeal of every song.

Go read the whole thing, especially the bits where he tears into Gabriel's cover of Radiohead's "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" and has to resort to all caps.
