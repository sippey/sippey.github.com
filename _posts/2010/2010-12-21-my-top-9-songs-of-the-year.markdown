<p>Top tens are so over. Here are my top 9 favorite tracks from 2010.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfySK7CLEEg" target="_self">first</a> <a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/" target="_self">two</a> I have to put on there because I&#39;m a white guy over the age of 40. Two songs about telephones, both of which had excellent music videos (go <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgM_V1j6CoI" target="_self">watch</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVBsypHzF3U" target="_self">them</a>). Rihanna because even though people think she&#39;s a robot I thought <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTA23UvltvU" target="_self">she chewed up the stage</a> on Letterman. (Mmmm, robots.) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7W0DMAx8FY" target="_self">Kanye</a> because. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRaUC-wrx8" target="_self">Sade</a> as the anti-Kanye, and that whole record kills. James Blake&#39;s cover of the Feist song is mind-blowing, <a href="http://vimeo.com/15624524" target="_self">the video makes it better</a>, and that&#39;s even before I understood his whole &quot;thing&quot; with the dubstep. And finally, as <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sippey/status/12995067807535105" target="_self">previously tweeted</a>, Reznor clearly trumped Daft Punk in the great soundtrack war of 2010, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaztFAh23vs" target="_self">reprise of Hand Covers Bruise</a>, which comes about 3/4th of the way through the record knocks your socks off the way reprises should.</p>
