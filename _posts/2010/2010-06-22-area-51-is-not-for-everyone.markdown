Really, it's not. Joel says so [right here](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/06/22.html):

> Area 51 is not for everyone. If you don’t know what it’s for, or why it’s going to work, or you can’t figure it out, it’s not, actually for you.

[Go see if it's for you](http://area51.stackexchange.com/). It's probably not. **And that's OK.**
