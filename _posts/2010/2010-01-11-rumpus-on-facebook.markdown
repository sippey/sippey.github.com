This Rumpus [interview with an anonymous Facebook employee](http://therumpus.net/2010/01/conversations-about-the-internet-5-anonymous-facebook-employee/?full=yes) is making the rounds; this is the bit that struck me...

> **Rumpus:** What’s the most bizarre \[Facebook interaction you have had\]?
> 
> **Employee****:** I found a fake account created from Berkeley that used the profile picture and information from the brother of one of my very good friends. We looked up the guy who created the original profile, and he had never ever heard of him, never ever met him, obviously had never seen him. But this guy had evidently added him as a friend, and sadly he accepted it, but literally stole all of this guy’s information, created a fake account, and was communicating with himself from the fake account. He was writing on his wall and posting back to the “other person’s” wall. We found out the guy actually had about fifteen fake accounts that he created, stealing other users’ pictures and information to create the accounts, and was actually communicating back and forth with himself. Just to try to make himself appear cool, I guess?
