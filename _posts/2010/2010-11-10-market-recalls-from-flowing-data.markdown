<p>Nathan Yau from Flowing data <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/11/10/making-recalls-and-market-withdrawls-more-accessible/">banged out a weekend project</a> to scrape the FDA&#39;s feed of product and market withdrawls and <a href="http://recalls.flowingdata.com/" target="_self">make it browsable</a> by time and company.  It&#39;s all done in Django, and Nathan&#39;s <a href="https://code.google.com/p/product-recalls/">made the apps available on Google Code</a>.  More like this, please.</p>
