Instapaper 2.2 on the iPhone is [really good](http://ben.stupidfool.org/typepad/2010/02/pagination-in-instapaper.html). So much so that I'm now Instapapering things that I know I should read eventually, but that in browser cry out for "tl,dr\[1\]" snark. Like, say, Gruber's [opus on the Apple patent cluster](http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/this_apple_htc_patent_thing).

\[1\] Too long, didn't read.
