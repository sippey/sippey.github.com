<p>Currently connected to the flatscreen TV in the living room:  one cable box from Comcast, one Apple TV, one Wii and one Blu-Ray player with integrated Netflix subscription.  We're not lacking for widescren entertainment options.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.google.com/tv">Google TV</a> is going to have a shot at displacing one of those boxes (or even joining them and their mess of cabling) it's going to have to do something radically better.  And I'm not quite sure a search box interface is it.  I don't have problems <em>finding</em> things I already know I want to watch. I do have a problem <em>discovering</em> things I should be watching that I didn't know about before.  And in my mind that's a social problem, not a search problem.</p>

<p>Thought experiment:  what if tomorrow Facebook announced Facebook TV?  Would their default UI -- a stream of recommended items from your friends -- be more or less compelling than Google's search box?</p>
