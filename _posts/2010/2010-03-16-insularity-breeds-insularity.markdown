Great [interview at HuffPo with Gina Welch](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/benyamin-cohen/6-questions-for-an-atheis_b_489144.html), the Berkeley-raised\[1\] author of the new book _In the Land of Believers_, in which she documents her two years of being "undercover" at [Jerry Falwell's church](http://home.trbc.org/) in Lynchburg, Virginia.

> **What was the biggest surprise you found during your journey?**

> The biggest surprise for me was the individual reflectiveness of church members. I think I'd had this stereotype of evangelicals as blisteringly arrogant dogmatists. But I observed instead humility and a kind of obsessive self-reflection, enacted through prayer. They call it listening to God's voice, but from it seemed to me like a constant internal pat-down of conscience, which really resulted in care with choices, and a movingly ample capacity for selflessness and generosity. I learned a lot by their example.

> A secondary surprise was that I felt implicated in the ignorance I observed -- relating to gay rights, to the environment, to feminism. I started to believe that their reactionary attitudes on these subjects were a result of profound insularity, which itself seemed the legacy of a culture that rejected them: mine. Why would they open themselves up to influence from a culture that made no space for their beliefs?

\[1\] As [Berkeleyside](http://www.berkeleyside.com/2010/03/16/from-the-land-of-nonbelievers/) points out, this is code for "liberal, atheist."
