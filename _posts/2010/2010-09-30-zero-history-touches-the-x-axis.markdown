I just finished William Gibson's _[Zero History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_History)_, and while I'm a fan of his characters and his prose, something bothered me about the new book: it's set _now_.

While I'm not a hard core fan or student of Gibson's work, I've read most of his novels. _Neuromancer_ and the sprawl trilogy? Felt way out in the future. _Virtual Light_ and the bridge trilogy? A bit closer to the present, but still far enough out to feel distinctly different.

His latest trilogy is much more of the moment. According to Wikipedia _[Pattern Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_(novel))_ was set a year before it was published (2003). That may be pedantically true, and the setting was recognizable, but the action in the book still felt like it was 5-10 years out. _Spook Country_Â got closer to "now," it felt like it was maybe 2-3 years out. But _Zero History_? Very much today. Very now. Very much right now today this absolute moment kind of now.

If you plot the bibliographic timeline on the x axis and the delta between publication date and when the books "felt" like they were set, and you squint really hard, you get something that looks like this.

_Zero History_ touches the X axis. And while I love the other two books in this trilogy, I couldn't love this one. There's too much Twitter. Too much iPhone. Too much MacBook Air. Too much selvedge denim. It's too close to home, and I couldn't help but start feeling a little [Cayce Pollard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayce_Pollard)-ish allergic reaction to all the brand names, and all that now-ness.
