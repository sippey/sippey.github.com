<p>I just finished William Gibson&#39;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_History" target="_self">Zero History</a></em>, and while I&#39;m a fan of his characters and his prose, something bothered me about the new book: it&#39;s set <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m not a hard core fan or student of Gibson&#39;s work, I&#39;ve read most of his novels.  <em>Neuromancer</em> and the sprawl trilogy?  Felt way out in the future.  <em>Virtual Light</em> and the bridge trilogy? A bit closer to the present, but still far enough out to feel distinctly different.</p>
<p>His latest trilogy is much more of the moment. According to Wikipedia <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_(novel)">Pattern Recognition</a></em> was set a year before it was published (2003). That may be pedantically true, and the setting was recognizable, but the action in the book still felt like it was 5-10 years out.  <em>Spook Country</em>&#0160;got closer to &quot;now,&quot; it felt like it was maybe 2-3 years out.  But <em>Zero History</em>? Very much today.  Very now.  Very much right now today this absolute moment kind of now.</p>
<p>If you plot the bibliographic timeline on the x axis and the delta between publication date and when the books &quot;felt&quot; like they were set, and you squint really hard, you get something that looks like this.</p>

<p><em>Zero History</em> touches the X axis.  And while I love the other two books in this trilogy, I couldn&#39;t love this one.  There&#39;s too much Twitter. Too much iPhone.  Too much MacBook Air. Too much selvedge denim.  It&#39;s too close to home, and I couldn&#39;t help but start feeling a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayce_Pollard">Cayce Pollard</a>-ish allergic reaction to all the brand names, and all that now-ness.</p>
