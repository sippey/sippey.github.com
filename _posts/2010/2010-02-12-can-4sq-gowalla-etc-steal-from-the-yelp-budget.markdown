Tweet of the day [from Chris Dixon](http://twitter.com/cdixon/status/9021780459):

> checkins: commodity. game mechanics: too easily copied. social graph: fb/twitter. tips/recs: v. interesting. monetization: most defensible.

And to pile on, monetization isn't just about the monetization _engine_, it's about building the relationships with the people who actually trust you enough to pay you money...and repeatedly pay you money for value delivered. And if we're talking about the local-mobile-social space, then it's going to be very interesting to see the upstarts (Foursquare, Gowalla, etc.) take on Yelp, who has a huge headstart in building [monetized relationships](http://www.yelp.com/business) with local businesses.

Question: is there enough dissatisfaction amongst small businesses with Yelp that there's an opportunity for a newcomer to steal away the Yelp budget? Or will it be possible for said newcomer to convince the small business owner that there's a need for incremental marketing spend through another local channel?
