> “How’s that hopey-changey thing workin’ out for you?”

via [www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/politics/08palin.html?hp)

So when the New York Times quotes Sarah Palin like this, do they do shorten the word "working" to "workin'" themselves? If it's just her accent / manner of speaking, then shouldn't they be doing that for every quote they transcribe? (Did they do this for Clinton, for example?) On the flipside, if they're not shortening this themselves, and actually getting the quote from the teleprompter transcript, then is Palin's camp writing in the shortened form of the word in order to make sure she hits the homey accents?
