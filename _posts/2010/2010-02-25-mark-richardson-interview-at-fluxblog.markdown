Fluxblog's Matthew Perpetua posts a [long, in-depth discussion](http://www.fluxblog.org/2010/02/fluxblog-interview-with-mark-richardson) with Pitchfork's Mark Richardson about The Flaming Lips. (Richardson's written a book about their record [Zaireeka](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0826429017).) I loved this sentence:

> I am drawn to experiences that take some work to make happen, because, since they require work, they will inevitably not happen as frequently.
