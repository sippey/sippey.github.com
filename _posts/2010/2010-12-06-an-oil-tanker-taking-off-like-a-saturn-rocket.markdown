<p>Composer John Adams has a <a href="http://www.earbox.com/posts/101" target="_self">great post up on his blog</a> about the last minute scramble to finish and score <em>Harmonielehre</em>&#0160;for its premier with the San Francisco Symphony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Harmonielehre&quot; was the victim of the worst case of writer’s block I ever endured—eighteen months, in fact—and when I finally found the &quot;code&quot; and started frantically composing I had only a couple of months to grind out hundreds of pages of dense orchestral scoring. Most pages had thirty-two staves, and I went through number five Turquoise drafting pencils at the rate of one a day, my arm aching like an overworked fastball pitcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole story&#39;s insane. &#0160;If you don&#39;t know <em>Harmonielehre</em>, you should. A friend of mine once called it maximalist minimalism; here&#39;s a taste.</p>
