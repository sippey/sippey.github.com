<p>I&#39;ve been hearing about <a href="http://www.siri.com/">Siri</a> for a while -- a friend works for the company, and the app&#39;s been in development for a <i>long</i> time -- but it was absolutely worth the wait.</p>

<blockquote><p>Siri is young and, like a child taking its first steps, may be awkward at times. Siri may occasionally misunderstand things you ask it to do even within its range of understanding. Nonetheless, Siri will improve quickly by getting to know you better and understanding a broader set of tasks. In fact, right now, Siri’s learning how to handle reminders, flights stats and reference questions. Our vision is that, over time, you’ll trust Siri to manage many personal details in your life - from recommending a wine you might enjoy to managing your to do list.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since Apple won&#39;t let users customize what&#39;s triggered with a long press of the iPhone&#39;s home button, they should just buy the company and turn this into the default Voice Control app.</p>
