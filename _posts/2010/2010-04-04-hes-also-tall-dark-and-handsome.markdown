The New York Times [plants a wet one on David Remnick](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05remnick.html), literary super hero.

> He reports, writes and edits, a player-coach combination that works in magazine about as often as a Bill Russell shows up in the National Basketball Association; his families, writers and advertising clients feel like they are his focus; and he counts pennies at one of the most luxe publishing companies in the world.

In addition to editing The New Yorker, Remnick has a 672-page [biography](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400043603/ref=nosim/statingtheobviou) of Barack Obama coming out this week. Just the thought of _reading_ that book makes me exhausted.
