> Tiger wasn't apologizing to actual people, to his wife or kids or even his confused fans. Tiger was apologizing, straight up and to the bone, to _capitalism itself_. To his own brand. It was a scary attempt to shore up the multimillions in endorsement deals, his future as a billion-dollar icon. Tiger the man was apologizing to Tiger, Inc., mostly for tainting its earnings potential.

Mark Morfold takes apart's Tiger's public apology in only the way Morford can. That graf right there? Probably the tamest thing in the whole piece.
