Rex Sorgatz (for Dan Abrams) launches [Sports Grid](http://www.sportsgrid.com/), which I think could be (inadequately, narrow-mindedly) pitched as "ESPN meets The Awl."

> Our goal is a simple one: to cover the culture of sports and entertainment, as well as the media personalities who talk and write about it, in a fun, compelling and easy to consume way. Perhaps more importantly, we also aim to objectively rank the legions of participants of our favorite pastimes by tracking who is – at any given moment – receiving the most “buzz” from his or her actions on and off the field.

Theory: Sports Grid is a bet to build a future home for [Bill Simmons](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/simmons/index), whose contract with ESPN is up this summer. In the sports media world, he's the free agent that matters. Which I now know _for a fact_, thanks to the Sports Grid [Power Grid for writers](http://www.sportsgrid.com/power-grid/writers/).
