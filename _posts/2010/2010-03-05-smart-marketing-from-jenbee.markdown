> The tradeshows of the art world, art fairs can leave even the most avid art enthusiast feeling deflated by day's end. To help keep everyone in high spirits during the NYC art marathon that started yesterday, [Jen Bekman](http://www.jenbekman.com/) and the team behind her online art initiative [20x200](http://www.20x200.com/indexp.html) will be handing out survival kits packed with a [Daily Candy](http://www.dailycandy.com/new-york/) city guide, artist [Jason Polan](http://www.jasonpolan.com/index2.html)'s clever hand-drawn map, a "Visual Palate Cleansing System" for the visually overstimulated and much more.

Having done more than a couple fairs in my lifetime, I can absolutely testify to the "deflated" feeling. Kudos to Jen Bekman for her smart kit for surviving this week's New York fairs.
