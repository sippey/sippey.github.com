[Tony Curtis to Roger Ebert in 1985](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850514/PEOPLE/100609983):

> "Let me tell you a story, sort of a parable. One day in 1948 I went to Hollywood. My name was Bernie Schwartz. I signed a contract at Universal, and I bought a house in the hills. It had a swimming pool. Unheated, but it had water in it. One night I came home late, I jumped in the pool, I swam a few laps, I got out, I dried myself off, I put on my clothes, and I walked directly into this room and sat down and started to talk to you. Do you see what I'm saying? Thirty-eight years, I don't know where they went. Gone like that.”
> 
> He shook his head, slowly. “Yesterday, I jumped in that pool,” he said. “Jeez, the water was cold.”

I love that Ebert's archives are available online, and that the [man himself](http://twitter.com/ebertchicago) is so great at mining the good stuff.
