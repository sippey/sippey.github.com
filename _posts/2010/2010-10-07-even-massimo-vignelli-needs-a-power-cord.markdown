<p>Was interested to learn (<a href="http://kottke.org/10/10/a-short-film-about-desks" target="_self">via kottke</a>) about this <a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/featured/10/502" target="_self">short film about desks</a> from Imaginary Forces. And, like Jason, I love this photo of Massimo Vignelli&#39;s desk.</p>
<p><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0133f4ea6009970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Massimo-vignelli-desk" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0133f4ea6009970b" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0133f4ea6009970b-500wi" title="Massimo-vignelli-desk" /></a></p>
<p>But unless Vignelli has an intern whose full time job is to quick (!) plug in the master&#39;s laptop anytime he&#39;s not looking to make sure the master&#39;s MacBook never runs out of power, then his desk most likely looks something like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0134880a2de3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vignelli-with-cord" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0134880a2de3970c" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0134880a2de3970c-500wi" title="Vignelli-with-cord" /></a></p>
<p>Just sayin&#39;.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;Walt Dickinson recommends that the master <a href="http://blog.iwalt.com/2010/10/massimo-vignellis-desk.html" target="_self">drill a hole in his desk</a> in order to minimize how much cord lays there. The more I think about it, though, the more I&#39;m of the opinion that he has a power supply intern, full time.</p>
