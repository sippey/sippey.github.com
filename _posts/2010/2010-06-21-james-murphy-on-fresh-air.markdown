Terry Gross [interviews LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127745800). I loved this bit about the job of being in a band, and the shift he's going to make...

> There are a lot of things I'd like to do that I can't really do because I have this job. So I thought like three albums — a nice trilogy over a decade — it feels like a good time to stop being a professional band. That doesn't mean LCD will stop. It just means I'll go back to the beginning: releasing a track here and there or being more fluid about my decision-making rather than albums, videos, singles, tour. Rather than this professional arch of being in a band, I'd like to go back to being a person who decides what he likes to do and pursues something new once in a while.

His sign-off is worthwhile, too, but I won't spoil it for you.
