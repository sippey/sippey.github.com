Alex Ross reblogs his [1997 New Yorker piece on Pavement](http://www.therestisnoise.com/2008/07/pavement-1997.html).

> A Pavement album is a series of small labyrinths. The pleasure of the maze matters more than finding a way out.

If you're a Pavement fan (like me) you'll read this. If you're not a Pavement fan, you're most likely getting ill on the vast amount of ink that music writers have been spilling lately. In that case, best to avoid.
