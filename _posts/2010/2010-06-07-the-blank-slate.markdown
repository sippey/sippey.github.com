In the future, all Apple product prognostications should be as simple as a [cutting a piece of cardboard](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/apples-magic-trackpad-revealed/) to a particular set of dimensions. "It will be about this big, and it will do magical things."

Looking forward to today's keynote, where I'm sure more magical non-cardboard-based things will be uncovered. Can't believe it's been [two years](http://www.sippey.com/2008/06/on-stage.html). Time flies.
