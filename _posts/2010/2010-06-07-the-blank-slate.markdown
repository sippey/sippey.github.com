<p>In the future, all Apple product prognostications should be as simple as a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/apples-magic-trackpad-revealed/">cutting a piece of cardboard</a> to a particular set of dimensions. "It will be about this big, and it will do magical things."</p>

<p>Looking forward to today's keynote, where I'm sure more magical non-cardboard-based things will be uncovered.  Can't believe it's been <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2008/06/on-stage.html">two years</a>.  Time flies.</p>
