File under: this type of coverage makes me seriously doubt what I'm reading about topics I know less about. CNN covers the "[major new app store](http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/15/app.store/index.html)" that the wireless carriers are cooking up. And the story's written as if this will finally allow consumers to get apps for their iPhones from someone besides Apple:

> The groups said their site will give app developers a simple route to publishing and marketing, and will offer smartphone customers new apps quicker and a wider selection than anyone else. ... Until now, Apple has had control over all apps that run on its iPhones, offering them only through the company's official online store.

Literally unbelievable.

Off to read some CNN.com coverage of health care, the financial markets and the war in Afghanistan!
