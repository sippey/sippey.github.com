File under "the things you do for love," but we took the kids to see _The Squeakquel_ over the holidays. It was possibly the worst movie I've ever paid to see in the theater. But The New Yorker's Ken Marks [disagreed](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_squeakquel_thomas).

> The visages of the rockinâ€™ rodents are, in fact, remarkably expressive, the jokes are reasonably funny, the lesson of sticking by your pals is not too corny, and the battle-of-the-bands finale, in which Toby accepts some grownup responsibility and finds love in the process, is surprisingly moving.
