<p>danah boyd has a <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/10/08/pep-rally-a-truly-exogenous-trending-topic-on-twitter.html" target="_self">great post up</a> about endogenous v. exogenous trending topics on Twitter, after seeing &quot;Pep Rally&quot; make it to the list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s Friday in the middle of October.  A lot of high schools will have homecoming games tonight.  Whenever there’s a homecoming game in the States (and often for other games too), there are pep rallies at the end of the school day. Schools typically let out around 2.30PM.  So around 3PM, I login to Twitter and voila, Pep Rally is a trending topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love fall. Who wouldn&#39;t love a little pep rally right about now?</p>
<p><strong>Update, 5:16 pm: </strong>trending now in the U.S. is &quot;Homecoming Game.&quot; &#0160;Perfect.</p>
