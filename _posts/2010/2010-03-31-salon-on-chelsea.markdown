> The sad truth is that, outside of her "I love to drink! Look at my ass!" comfort zone, Handler has remarkably little to say. But, hey, if college taught us anything, it's that a girl can go far on "I love to drink! Look at my ass!" Like, say, the New York Times bestseller list.Â

Dear Salon: sometimes "I like to drink! Look at my ass!" is just good (enough) entertainment. Chelsea on E! is occasionally a [satisficing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) alternative to JayDaveJimmy, and not everyone needs to be as funny / "transgressive" as Sarah Silverman.
