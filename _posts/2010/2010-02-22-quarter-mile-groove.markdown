Today and Tomorrow points to [Quarter Mile Groove](http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/2010/02/22/quarter-mile-groove/), a conceptual art piece by Daniel Eatock.

> The recording translates the length of its vinyl groove into audio allowing listeners to experience the 1/4 mile length of the spiral as the record is played.

I like that Eatock included the vinyl residue of the initial master cutting of the record as part of the piece. When unraveled it would (obviously) be a quarter-mile long.
