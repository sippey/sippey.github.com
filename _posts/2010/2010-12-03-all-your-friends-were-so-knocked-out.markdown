<p>The NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/nyregion/04kaufman.html">obit for Elaine Kaufman</a> is worth reading, especially if you were a suburban kid who enjoyed Woody Allen movies and bothered to listen to Billy Joel lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Kaufman treated many of her regular patrons as both friends and extended family, though she had her limits. She had several run-ins with well-known personalities. After an argument with her, Norman Mailer vowed never to return and wrote her an unflattering letter. She scribbled “Boring” across the top and sent it back to him. A day or two later, he was back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Reminder: even if this Mailer story is fake, <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/11/even-if-its-fake-its-real.html">it&#39;s still real</a>.)</p>
