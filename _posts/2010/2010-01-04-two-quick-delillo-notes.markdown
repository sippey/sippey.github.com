First, Richard Rayner posts [an appreciation of White Noise](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-caw-paperback-writers3-2010jan03,0,4308244.story) on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.

> Perhaps DeLillo came back to America and so soaked up the assault of its teeming everyday, its wondrous and paranoid present, that he couldn't help but enclose the darkness of the future. "White Noise" won the National Book Award in 1985 and quickly became an inspiration and influence. Without it, writers such as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an excellent introduction here) don't happen -- or don't happen in the same way.
