Every once in a while I get lucky and actually state the obvious. Here's a bit from [my post on Siri back in February](http://www.sippey.com/2010/02/siri-was-worth-the-wait.html):

> Since Apple won't let users customize what's triggered with a long press of the iPhone's home button, they should just buy the company and turn this into the default Voice Control app.

I'm very happy to read this morning that [Siri's been acquired by Apple](http://scobleizer.com/2010/04/28/breaking-news-siri-bought-by-apple/). Congrats to the Siri team (yay Harry!); this makes perfect sense for both companies. And if you haven't tried [Siri](http://siri.com/) \-\- go get it now.
