I'm sure Claire Cain Miller's [piece in the New York Times about Twitter's ad program](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/technology/internet/13twitter.html?ref=business) will be combed over by, well, thousands and thousands of [experts](http://twitter.com/jennyholzer/status/12089469820) with fine-toothed combs. I'll just comb over this particular paragraph.

> Once Twitter figures out how to measure the number of people who read posts other than on Twitter.com, it will also allow third-party developers to show ads and share revenue.

I bet we hear more about this piece of the puzzle this week at [Chirp](http://chirp.twitter.com/). The strength of Twitter is in its reach as a platform...but from an advertiser's perspective the weakness of Twitter is in the (current) inability to measure the actual reach (vs. [potential reach](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/12/life-on-the-list.html "Anil Dash's post about life on the Suggested User List")) of a message. So if I'm reading Miller's paragraph correctly (and she's transmitting correctly), the bargain for third-party developers is pretty clear: you share stats about who's seeing what tweets when and where, and we'll share ad revenue with you.

And you know what? This is _just like every other online ad network._ And this is a good thing; it's a value exchange that's easy to understand. Take [AdSense](http://www.google.com/services/adsense_tour/howitworks.html), for instance. Every microsecond of every day publishers give Google real estate on their sites. Google gets to learn all sorts of things about their traffic patterns -- who reads what pages when and from where; in return the publisher gets a cut of the advertising revenue that Google generates in that real estate. Data for revenue.

I also think this puts the Blackberry and iPhone client moves last week in context. Now that they have Twitter-branded clients on two large mobile platforms, they have healthy chunk of owned & operated mobile inventory. Which means they don't need to negotiate the revenue cut with any third party developers for the initial launch, and they can take a while to learn -- gather data, observe the user experience, gauge advertiser reaction, etc. And it will give them an opportunity to develop a set of best practices for clients about how to report this kind of data back to Twitter.

They're doing this right. The tweet's a natural ad unit, and they're finding the right ways to introduce them into the user experience. Search first, tweet stream on their own O&O properties next, then out through third party clients. Evolve the right way to make it a net positive for the ecosystem. Evolve the "resonance" algorithm. Get a handle on the reach of the platform. And all the while encourage new types of applications.

Here we go.
