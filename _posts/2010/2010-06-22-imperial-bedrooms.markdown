Queued up in the reading list: Bret Easton Ellis's _[Imperial Bedrooms](http://amzn.to/bvd7Rg)_, the sequel to his 1985 novel _[Less Than Zero](http://amzn.to/bzvyRK)_. And because books now come with trailers...

If you're in New York tonight, you can go hear [Andrew McCarthy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000530/) (who played the character Clay in the movie version of _Less Than Zero_) read from _Imperial Bedrooms_ [at the Barnes and Noble in Union Square](http://www.papermag.com/2010/06/andrew_mccarthy_to_read_from_b.php). Bring your own blow.
