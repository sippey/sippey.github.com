<p>In The Atlantic, Matthew Battles writes 673 words on smartphones, apps and &quot;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/11/a-new-wrinkle-in-time/8249/" target="_self">the decline of the wristwatch</a>.&quot; I&#39;ll spare you the vast majority of those words (and the obligatory Dali ripoff illustration). He concludes...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matched against the almost infinite possibilities of the smart phone, the watch seems likely to slowly go the way of the sundial, the factory whistle, and other quaint measures.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Office</em> did it better. In the middle of Andy&#39;s production of <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, Kelly asks Ryan what time it is. Ryan pulls out his iPad and launches a massive clock app.</p>

<p>So good.</p>
