<p>Here's the trailer for <em>Takers</em>, the first movie where you can <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020636.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;ref=vertfilm">trade box office futures</a> on a Commodity Futures Trading Commission-sanctioned exchange.</p>

<p>According to Variety...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To win approval, Media Derivatives agreed to a number of conditions that are designed to address concerns about market manipulation. ... Among them is a rule that will require "entities and individuals who control a film's marketing budget, release date or opening screen number" -- in other words, a studio and its top executives -- "to provide the Exchange with information regarding such decisions whenever that entity or individual holds a position of 1,000 or more contracts."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Takers</em> opens August 20th.  Better get your bets in quick; the financial reform bill includes language that would ban box office futures-trading, effectively reversing the CFTC's ruling.</p>
