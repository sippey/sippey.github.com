Tiff blogs about how kids get pissed off when they learn that Pluto isn't a planet. BUT! Check out the dateline on that letter -- November 6, 2006. Kids that have been learning about planets since Pluto's been declassified have a completely different take...

Case in point: took the kids to the [Chabot Space and Science Center](http://www.chabotspace.org/) this past weekend, and watched a great film with them about the solar system. My when the kids in the movie flying their animated cardboard rocket finally made it to Pluto my nine year old turned to me with this shocked look on her face and whispered "But Dad! Pluto's not a planet!"
