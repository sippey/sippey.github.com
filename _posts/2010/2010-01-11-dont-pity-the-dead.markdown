Paul Ford, [Just Like Heaven](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/the_non-expert/just_like_heaven.php).

> But don’t pity the dead. They have time on their mouldering hands, and all they do is think of ways to vex us. They watch we living go about our dirty business—lying and cheating; penis-pumping; pirating pop music—and smile, amused, cool, indifferent, they’re like high-functioning heroin addicts, or cats.
