Over at [GeekWeek](http://www.geekweek.com/), Luke Thompson's been reviewing various fast food items. Up this week, the [Wendy's Premium Fish Fillet](http://www.geekweek.com/2010/02/fast-food-review-wendys-premium-fish-fillet.html).

> Lighter, these are not. The piece of fish on my sandwich was dwarfed by the bun (Hey Wendy’s, I think I hear the ghost of Clara Peller: “Where’s the fish?”), and the fish itself was dominated by the, ahem, “Panko.” Wendy’s dense buns are good for burgers loaded with drippy toppings – if they were to bring back some kind of chili cheeseburger, I’d advocate them – but when you’re dealing with an already-breaded product, it’s a bit much. The fish was also a bit too salty for my tastes, though I tend to like less salt than most, but a hint of slight spiciness was welcome. Beyond that, they add lettuce, sauce, and – for forty more cents! – cheese.

This isn't an ironic foodie review ("Oh, look how hip we are appreciating the fast food"), this is from a true fast-food lover. Who else would know so much about Wendy's dense buns?
