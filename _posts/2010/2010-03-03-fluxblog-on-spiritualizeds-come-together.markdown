> On other tracks from _Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space_, the waves of sound are comforting and numbing, but in this, it pounds down on you, like he’s trying to beat some sense into himself. It’s futile, though — as the song tapers off and bleeds into the woozy opening section of [“I Think I’m In Love,”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Za161pBwBA) it’s like slipping back into a stupor.
