> You know what happened, really and without irony? I had an opportunity to be an editor at _Harper's_, to edit pieces for the magazine. It was something I expected to really want. I had wonderful editors to learn from. I did a little of it for print and a lot for the web. I wasn't bad at it, even. Not great, but not bad. I could have been a respected editor instead of a huge nerd. But all the editing in the world can't compare to building little websites and mangling text and writing things and messing around in spreadsheets and figuring out what's wrong with comments. I wake up thinking about how all the pieces fit together and I want to do more of it and with lots of people. I plan to be scared and exhausted most of the time. So far that's working.

Choire catches up with Paul Ford now that he's left Harper's and is working with our friend Mr. Dash at Activate. The whole interview is great, but it's the "without irony" bit that's fantastic.
