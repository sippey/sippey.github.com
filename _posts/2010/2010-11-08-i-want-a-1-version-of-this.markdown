<p>Via <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/design/circle-hook-lig.php">Cool Hunting</a> comes this really clever fluorescent light bulb fixture. Only problem: it&#39;s made of brass and costs $920. What we need is the functional equivalent of the porcelain keyless incandescent fixture that goes for $1 at your neighborhood Home Depot...but for the circular fluorescent bulb.</p>
