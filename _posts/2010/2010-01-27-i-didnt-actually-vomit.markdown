Jason Chen, in the pre-game [Gizmodo liveblog](http://live.gizmodo.com/) of the Apple announcement: "Weâ€™re still about 10 minutes away from the event starting. I wonder if the guys backstage are vomiting from nervousness. I would be."

I didn't _actually_ vomit, but yes. That's the feeling. And thinking about it now makes my palms sweat and my stomach churn, a year and a half later. What got me through it was the support from the fantastic people at Apple, who I'm thinking about today.
