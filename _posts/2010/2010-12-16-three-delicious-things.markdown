<p>Three small things about the rumored impending sunsetting of Delicious.</p>
<p>First, it&#39;s easy to grab an archive of all your bookmarks, and there are plenty of services that you can import them into. &#0160;But I never used Delicious as something to &quot;store&quot; things, I used it as a place for link blogging. Delicious wasn&#39;t about personal utility, it was about public performance.</p>
<p>So I just grabbed my archives and <a href="http://stuff.sippey.com/bookmarks/" target="_self">put them up here</a>, where it&#39;s back to being about personal utility. Bookmark activity back to 2003! &#0160;Kind of fun, actually.</p>
<p>Second, one of the things I found there was a <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2003/12/05/#TRACKING" target="_self">December 2003 bit in NTK</a>, the fantastic brit email newsletter from the early aughts, about del.icio.us itself. &#0160;I&#39;ve screenshotted the paragraph because if you were around the web then and read NTK, it will send you down a nostalgia tunnel so deep and long as to have no end.</p>

<p>Third, while having no clue what the hell Yahoo!! (so great now it deserves two exclamation points) is doing shuttering one of their Web 2.0 darlings, I absolutely loved <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fakecarolbartz/status/15508907745087488" target="_self">this tweet</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/fakecarolbartz" target="_self">@fakecarolbartz</a>.</p>
