Delivered just in time, [Apple's New 10 Commandments](http://mosjef.typepad.com/mosjef/2010/01/apples-new-10-commandments.html), from Jeff Reine. "Thou shall not steal hardware...but if thou stealest a little music now and then I shall turn a blind eye because you know... bits want to be free and all that... I mean it's a zero marginal cost product. C'mon, now."
