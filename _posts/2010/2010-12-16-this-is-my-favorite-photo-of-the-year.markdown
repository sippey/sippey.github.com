<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re following The Big Picture&#39;s 2010 in Photos series (here&#39;s <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/12/2010_in_photos_part_1_of_3.html" target="_self">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/12/2010_in_photos_part_2_of_3.html" target="_self">Part 2</a> and <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/12/2010_in_photos_part_3_of_3.html" target="_self">Part 3</a>). They&#39;re all great, but this one is my favorite.</p>

<p>Action and drama and fear and storytelling and metaphor, all wrapped up in one. The photos of the plane fireballing into the runway don&#39;t have near the impact of this one.</p>
