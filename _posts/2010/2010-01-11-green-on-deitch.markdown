Tyler Green at Modern Art Notes on [MOCA hiring Jeffrey Deitch](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/01/some_responses_to_mocas_new_di.html).

> In a [haven't-I-read-that-before](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/01/weekend_roundup_132.html) piece on New York magazine's [website](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/01/los_angeles_moca_set_to_name_j.html), Jerry Saltz pulls out this cliche: "\[B\]ear in mind that MOCA desperately needs to think outside the box..." Actually, no it doesn't. It was thinking "outside the box" (namely: profligate spending) that got MOCA into trouble in the first place. **MOCA needs to continue to do what it's done well for most of the last 30 years: collecting contemporary art and launching smart, historical, revisionist exhibitions and programs that define the period.**

Emphasis mine. I've written about both of them here before, but MOCA put on two shows in the early 90s that really formed the way I look at contemporary art today, and how museums put on shows: [Helter Skelter: LA Art in the 1990s](http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/3374) and [Rolywholyover A Circus](http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/2830). More like those, pls.
