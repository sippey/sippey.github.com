> I'd like a Chrome extension that redirects every article similar to the above to Armond White's [Transporter 3](http://www.nypress.com/article-19048-transcendent-thrill-drive.html), which is the last word on the topic as far as I am concerned.

via [hello.typepad.com](http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2010/03/we-know-that-the-story-is-a-construct-meant-to-elicit-a-response-and-then-become-a-cathartic-release-when-the-good-guys-win.html)

David is on to something with this idea for a browser extension. "Oh! You think _that_ article is interesting? Well you should check out the one that _really_ matters. You'll thank us later." Or instead of a browser extension imagine a campus-wide proxy server that detects and automatically redirects based on student browsing activity. (Included free with your tuition!) We'll call that act of redirecting GETTING BLASTED BY THE CANON.
