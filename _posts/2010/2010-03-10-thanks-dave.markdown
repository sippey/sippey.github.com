The news that Issue #60 ("[Append file support](http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=60)") in the Quick Search Box for the Mac bug tracker has been marked as "fixed" by Dave MacLachlan will make a vanishingly small number of people exceedingly happy.

And since the other 99.99% of you have no idea what I'm talking about you can move right along. There's nothing to see here.
