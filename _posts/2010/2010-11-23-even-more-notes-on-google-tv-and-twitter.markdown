<p>I had a chance to play with Google TV this past weekend at Best Buy, where there was a helpful blue-shirted employee doing a great job explaining the Sony set's benefits. Or, at least how the search function worked.</p>
<p>He didn't really understand how the apps worked, and couldn't really explain why I'd want to use them, and so I said "well, let's check out the Twitter one." Here's the roadblock we hit...</p>
<p><a title="Google TV Twitter logon by msippey, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/msippey/5202888798/"><img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5202888798_0509003b8c.jpg" alt="Google TV Twitter logon" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I wasn't really up for logging into Twitter in the middle of Best Buy with my personal account...so we didn't get past this screen.  But this shouldn't have been the first screen.</p>
<p>Twitter recently spent a bunch of cycles improving the first time user experience -- especially for users that have yet to make the leap into the registration process -- so that they can get a taste of what's available on Twitter without having to make the leap. If ever there were a use case where the logged out state could be interesting and valuable, it's with a device like Google TV.</p>
<p>Google TV shouldn't just be another Twitter client, it should be a contextual Twitter client. See that picture-in-picture frame right there? The device knows what we're watching <em>right now</em>, and so why not make the default view a real time search for tweets related to the show we're watching?  (It would be our own personal #vma display.)  And if there's not enough context to display real-time context, then take advantage of our history with the device.  It knows what shows we've searched for, what movies we've watched -- the default screen should present streams of tweets based on that information, along with recommended bundles of accounts to follow that would grease the funnel through the registration flow.</p>
<p>But, speaking of that registration flow...  I used the first person plural in that last paragraph on purpose. I don't have the data behind this, but I've got to believe that an awful lot of television watching happens with other people in the room. Would I even want to sign in to Google TV with <em>my</em> Twitter account? Why not my wife's?  Or my daughter's?  Fighting over the remote is one thing, fighting over personalized display of information layered on top of the show <em>everyone in the room is watching</em> is another.</p>
<p>Somewhere back in 2008, I silenced a debate about LOST spoilers with the simple declaration that <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2010/02/real-fans-watch.html">real fans watch</a>. Twitter's in a great position to help broadcast television become relevant again, by providing a communal experience <em>(nb: potentially distinct from a "community" experience)</em> layered on top of live television. But there's more work to do...</p>
