Tyler Green [covers the project](http://www.artsjournal.com/man/2010/02/putting_the_arch_back_in_st_lo.html) that will finally connect the Gateway Arch more directly to downtown St. Louis.

> The National Park Service and the city of St. Louis have sponsored a competition -- which seems to be called [Framing a Modern Masterpiece,](http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/) but which should be nicknamed something less metaphor-abusing -- to encourage architects to come up with plans to link downtown with the Arch with the Mississippi River. Yesterday the competition announced its nine finalists. The Architect's Newspaper [has the list](http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4234), as does the competition itself, [via PDF.](http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Nine-Teams-Reach-Second-Round-of-Gateway-Arch-Design-Competition-2-10-2010.pdf) (The list of [firms that entered](http://www.cityarchrivercompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Competition-Registration.pdf) is pretty impressive too. Saarinen's successor-firm, Roche-Dinkeloo, did not make the cut to nine.)

I grew up in St. Louis, so for me the Arch is myth-level sculpture; I blogged about [the relationship between the Arch and the new Busch Stadium](http://www.sippey.com/2009/07/the-arch.html) last summer.
