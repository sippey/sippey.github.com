Garrison Keillor comes to the shocking realization that unlike the kids of Lake Wobegon, [writers are no longer above average](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/opinion/27iht-edkeillor.html).

> And if you want to write, you just write and publish yourself. No need to ask permission, just open a Web site. And if you want to write a book, you just write it, send it to Lulu.com or BookSurge at Amazon or PubIt or ExLibris and youâ€™ve got yourself an e-book. No problem. And that is the future of publishing: 18 million authors in America, each with an average of 14 readers, eight of whom are blood relatives. Average annual earnings: $1.75.

Every sentence in this paragraph fills me with joy.
