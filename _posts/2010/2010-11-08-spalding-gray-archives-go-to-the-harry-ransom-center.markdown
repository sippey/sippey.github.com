<p>Back in March the University of Texas announced that their Harry Ransom Center had acquired the <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/03/the-dfw-archive.html">archives of David Foster Wallace</a>. Today it&#39;s the archives of <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/spalding-gray-archives-go-to-university-of-texas/">Spalding Gray</a>. The archive includes &quot;dozens if not hundreds of tapes of Gray&#39;s performances.&quot;</p>
