> Welcome to the last annual **America's Greatest Living American Abstract Painter Tournament.** Think of it as the NCAA tourney only with fewer corporate tie-ins, less sweat, fewer buzzer-beaters,Â  and cheerleaders by Mel Ramos. (If only!)

I'm imagining curatorial staffs in museums across the country filling out their brackets with the same fervor as college hoops fans in the cube farms where ESPN.com, Twitter.com, Facebook.com and sports.yahoo.com are all blocked by the corporate firewall.

(Also, market need! Lazyweb: please make an easy to use webapp version of a bracket tourney poll so that people can do things like this all the time!)
