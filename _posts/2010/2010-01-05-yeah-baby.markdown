<p>I'm slackjawed at this Gilbert Arenas thing.  TMZ <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/05/gilbert-arenas-nba-gun-unlicensed-weapon-assault/">reported</a> today that the gun he had was a gold-plated <a href="http://www.magnumresearch.com/Desert_Eagle.asp">Desert Eagle</a> handgun.</p>

<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0120a7aa3764970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0120a7aa3764970b" alt="Kaboom" src="https://sippey.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f5f53ef0120a7aa3764970b-500wi"  /></a> <br /></p>

<p>If that particular weapon looks familiar, it's because it's the same one used by <a href="http://www.sportsbybrooks.com/gils-golden-gun-same-as-saddam-austin-powers-27552">Austin Powers</a>.  Kaboom!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  <a href="http://mywifevsthedeserteagle.com/">mywifevsthedeserteagle.com</a> is about as far as I'll go. Because now my liberal tendencies start to click in and the gun culture thing makes my skin crawl and holy <em>crap</em> what the hell. Seriously.</p>
