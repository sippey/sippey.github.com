I'm slackjawed at this Gilbert Arenas thing. TMZ [reported](http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/05/gilbert-arenas-nba-gun-unlicensed-weapon-assault/) today that the gun he had was a gold-plated [Desert Eagle](http://www.magnumresearch.com/Desert_Eagle.asp) handgun.

If that particular weapon looks familiar, it's because it's the same one used by [Austin Powers](http://www.sportsbybrooks.com/gils-golden-gun-same-as-saddam-austin-powers-27552). Kaboom!

**Update:** [mywifevsthedeserteagle.com](http://mywifevsthedeserteagle.com/) is about as far as I'll go. Because now my liberal tendencies start to click in and the gun culture thing makes my skin crawl and holy _crap_ what the hell. Seriously.
